Abstract

Most current machine transliteration sys-
tems employ a corpus of known source-
target word pairs to train their system, and
typically evaluate their systems on a similar
corpus. In this paper we explore the perfor-
mance of transliteration systems on corpora
that are varied in a controlled way. In partic-
ular, we control the number, and prior lan-
guage knowledge of human transliterators
used to construct the corpora, and the origin
of the source words that make up the cor-
pora. We find that the word accuracy of au-
tomated transliteration systems can vary by
up to 30% (in absolute terms) depending on
the corpus on which they are run. We con-
clude that at least four human transliterators
should be used to construct corpora for eval-
uating automated transliteration systems;
and that although absolute word accuracy
metrics may not translate across corpora, the
relative rankings of system performance re-
mains stable across differing corpora.

1 Introduction

Machine transliteration is the process of transform-
ing a word written in a source language into a word
in a target language without the aid of a bilingual
dictionary. Word pronunciation is preserved, as far
as possible, but the script used to render the target
word is different from that of the source language.
Transliteration is applied to proper nouns and out-
of-vocabulary terms as part of machine translation
and cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) (Ab-
dulJaleel and Larkey, 2003; Pirkola et al., 2006).

Several transliteration methods are reported in the
literature for a variety of languages, with their per-
formance being evaluated on multilingual corpora.
Source-target pairs are either extracted from bilin-
gual documents or dictionaries (AbdulJaleel and
Larkey, 2003; Bilac and Tanaka, 2005; Oh and Choi,
2006; Zelenko and Aone, 2006), or gathered ex-
plicitly from human transliterators (Al-Onaizan and
Knight, 2002; Zelenko and Aone, 2006). Some eval-
uations of transliteration methods depend on a single
unique transliteration for each source word, while
others take multiple target words for a single source
word into account. In their work on transliterating
English to Persian, Karimi et al. (2006) observed
that the content of the corpus used for evaluating
systems could have dramatic affects on the reported
accuracy of methods.

The effects of corpus composition on the evalua-
tion of transliteration systems has not been specif-
ically studied, with only implicit experiments or
claims made in the literature such as introduc-
ing the effects of different transliteration mod-
els (AbdulJaleel and Larkey, 2003), language fam-
ilies (Lindén, 2005) or application based (CLIR)
evaluation (Pirkola et al., 2006). In this paper, we re-
port our experiments designed to explicitly examine
the effect that varying the underlying corpus used in
both training and testing systems has on translitera-
tion accuracy. Specifically, we vary the number of
human transliterators that are used to construct the
corpus; and the origin of the English words used in
the corpus.

Our experiments show that the word accuracy of
automated transliteration systems can vary by up to
30% (in absolute terms), depending on the corpus
used. Despite the wide range of absolute values

640



in performance, the ranking of our two translitera-
tion systems was preserved on all corpora. We also
find that a human’s confidence in the language from
which they are transliterating can affect the corpus
in such a way that word accuracy rates are altered.

2 Background

Machine transliteration methods are divided into
grapheme-based (AbdulJaleel and Larkey, 2003;
Lindén, 2005), phoneme-based (Jung et al., 2000;
Virga and Khudanpur, 2003) and combined tech-
niques (Bilac and Tanaka, 2005; Oh and Choi,
2006). Grapheme-based methods derive transforma-
tion rules for character combinations in the source
text from a training data set, while phoneme-based
methods use an intermediate phonetic transforma-
tion. In this paper, we use two grapheme-based
methods for English to Persian transliteration. Dur-
ing a training phase, both methods derive rules for
transforming character combinations (segments) in
the source language into character combinations in
the target language with some probability.

During transliteration, the source word si is seg-
mented and rules are chosen and applied to each seg-
ment according to heuristics. The probability of a
resulting word is the product of the probabilities of
the applied rules. The result is a list of target words
sorted by their associated probabilities, Li.

The first system we use (SYS-1) is an n-gram
approach that uses the last character of the previ-
ous source segment to condition the choice of the
rule for the current source segment. This system has
been shown to outperform other n-gram based meth-
ods for English to Persian transliteration (Karimi et
al., 2006).

The second system we employ (SYS-2) makes
use of some explicit knowledge of our chosen lan-
guage pair, English and Persian, and is also on
the collapsed-vowel scheme presented by Karimi et
al. (2006). In particular, it exploits the tendency for
runs of English vowels to be collapsed into a single
Persian character, or perhaps omitted from the Per-
sian altogether. As such, segments are chosen based
on surrounding consonants and vowels. The full de-
tails of this system are not important for this paper;
here we focus on the performance evaluation of sys-
tems, not the systems themselves.

2.1 System Evaluation

In order to evaluate the list Li of target words pro-
duced by a transliteration system for source word si,
a test corpus is constructed. The test corpus con-
sists of a source word, si, and a list of possible target
words {ti j}, where 1 ≤ j ≤ di, the number of dis-
tinct target words for source word si. Associated
with each ti j is a count ni j which is the number of
human transliterators who transliterated si into ti j.

Often the test corpus is a proportion of a larger
corpus, the remainder of which has been used for
training the system’s rule base. In this work we
adopt the standard ten-fold cross validation tech-
nique for all of our results, where 90% of a corpus
is used for training and 10% for testing. The pro-
cess is repeated ten times, and the mean result taken.
Forthwith, we use the term corpus to refer to the sin-
gle corpus from which both training and test sets are
drawn in this fashion.

Once the corpus is decided upon, a metric to mea-
sure the system’s accuracy is required. The appro-
priate metric depends on the scenario in which the
transliteration system is to be used. For example,
in a machine translation application where only one
target word can be inserted in the text to represent a
source word, it is important that the word at the top
of the system generated list of target words (by def-
inition the most probable) is one of the words gen-
erated by a human in the corpus. More formally,
the first word generated for source word si, L

i
1, must

be one of ti j,1 ≤ j ≤ di. It may even be desirable
that this is the target word most commonly used for
this source word; that is, Li1 = ti j such that ni j ≥ nik,
for all 1 ≤ k ≤ di. Alternately, in a CLIR appli-
cation, all variants of a source word might be re-
quired. For example, if a user searches for an En-
glish term “Tom” in Persian documents, the search
engine should try and locate documents that contain
both “�A�K” (3 letters: �H- �-�) and ”Õç�'”(2 letters: �H-�),
two possible transliterations of “Tom” that would be
generated by human transliterators. In this case, a
metric that counts the number of ti j that appear in
the top di elements of the system generated list, L

i,
might be appropriate.

In this paper we focus on the “Top-1” case, where
it is important for the most probable target word gen-
erated by the system, Li1 to be either the most pop-

641



ular ti j (labeled the Majority, with ties broken ar-
bitrarily), or just one of the ti j’s (labeled Uniform
because all possible transliterations are equally re-
warded). A third scheme (labeled Weighted) is also
possible where the reward for ti j appearing as L

i
1

is ni j/∑
di
j=1 ni j; here, each target word is given a

weight proportional to how often a human translit-
erator chose that target word. Due to space consid-
erations, we focus on the first two variants only.

In general, there are two commonly used met-
rics for transliteration evaluation: word accuracy
(WA) and character accuracy (CA) (Hall and Dowl-
ing, 1980). In all of our experiments, CA based
metrics closely mirrored WA based metrics, and
so conclusions drawn from the data would be the
same whether WA metrics or CA metrics were used.
Hence we only discuss and report WA based metrics
in this paper.

For each source word in the test corpus of K
words, word accuracy calculates the percentage of
correctly transliterated terms. Hence for the major-
ity case, where every source word in the corpus only
has one target word, the word accuracy is defined as

MWA = |{si|L
i
1 = ti1,1≤ i≤ K}|/K,

and for the Uniform case, where every target variant
is included with equal weight in the corpus, the word
accuracy is defined as

UWA = |{si|L
i
1 ∈ {ti j},1≤ i ≤ K,1≤ j ≤ di}|/K.

2.2 Human Evaluation

To evaluate the level of agreement between translit-
erators, we use an agreement measure based on Mun
and Eye (2004).

For any source word si, there are di different
transliterations made by the ni human translitera-
tors (ni = ∑

di
j=1 ni j, where ni j is the number of times

source word si was transliterated into target word
ti j). When any two transliterators agree on the
same target word, there are two agreements being
made: transliterator one agrees with transliterator
two, and vice versa. In general, therefore, the to-
tal number of agreements made on source word si is
∑dij=1 ni j(ni j − 1). Hence the total number of actual
agreements made on the entire corpus of K words is

Aact =
K

∑
i=1

di

∑
j=1

ni j(ni j −1).

The total number of possible agreements (that is,
when all human transliterators agree on a single tar-
get word for each source word), is

Aposs =
K

∑
i=1

ni(ni−1).

The proportion of overall agreement is therefore

PA =

.

2.3 Corpora

Seven transliterators (T1, T2, . . ., T7: all native Per-
sian speakers from Iran) were recruited to transliter-
ate 1500 proper names that we provided. The names
were taken from lists of names written in English on
English Web sites. Five hundred of these names also
appeared in lists of names on Arabic Web sites, and
five hundred on Dutch name lists. The transliterators
were not told of the origin of each word. The en-
tire corpus, therefore, was easily separated into three
sub-corpora of 500 words each based on the origin
of each word. To distinguish these collections, we
use E7, A7 and D7 to denote the English, Arabic and
Dutch sub-corpora, respectively. The whole 1500
word corpus is referred to as EDA7.

Dutch and Arabic were chosen with an assump-
tion that most Iranian Persian speakers have little
knowledge of Dutch, while their familiarity with
Arabic should be in the second rank after English.
All of the participants held at least a Bachelors de-
gree. Table 1 summarizes the information about
the transliterators and their perception of the given
task. Participants were asked to scale the difficulty
of the transliteration of each sub-corpus, indicated
as a scale from 1 (hard) to 3 (easy). Similarly, the
participants’ confidence in performing the task was
rated from 1 (no confidence) to 3 (quite confident).
The level of familiarity with second languages was
also reported based on a scale of zero (not familiar)
to 3 (excellent knowledge).

The information provided by participants con-
firms our assumption of transliterators knowledge
of second languages: high familiarity with English,
some knowledge of Arabic, and little or no prior
knowledge of Dutch. Also, the majority of them
found the transliteration of English terms of medium
difficulty, Dutch was considered mostly hard, and
Arabic as easy to medium.

3 Results

Figure 1 shows the values of UWA and MWA for
E7, A7, D7 and EDA7 using the two transliteration
systems. Immediately obvious is that varying the
corpora (x-axis) results in different values for word
accuracy, whether by the UWA or MWA method. For
example, if you chose to evaluate SYS-2 with the
UWA metric on the D7 corpus, you would obtain a
result of 82%, but if you chose to evaluate it with the
A7 corpus you would receive a result of only 73%.
This makes comparing systems that report results

obtained on different corpora very difficult. Encour-
agingly, however, SYS-2 consistently outperforms
the SYS-1 on all corpora for both metrics except
MWA on E7. This implies that ranking system per-
formance on the same corpus most likely yields a
system ranking that is transferable to other corpora.
To further investigate this, we randomly extracted
100 corpora of 500 word pairs from EDA7 and ran
the two systems on them and evaluated the results
using both MWA and UWA. Both of the measures
ranked the systems consistently using all these cor-
pora (Figure 2).

As expected, the UWA metric is consistently
higher than the MWA metric; it allows for the top
transliteration to appear in any of the possible vari-
ants for that word in the corpus, unlike the MWA
metric which insists upon a single target word. For
example, for the E7 corpus using the SYS-2 ap-
proach, UWA is 76.4% and MWA is 47.0%.

Each of the three sub-corpora can be further di-
vided based on the seven individual transliterators,
in different combinations. That is, construct a sub-
corpus from T1’s transliterations, T2’s, and so on;
then take all combinations of two transliterators,
then three, and so on. In general we can construct
7Cr such corpora from r transliterators in this fash-
ion, all of which have 500 source words, but may
have between one to seven different transliterations
for each of those words.

Figure 3 shows the MWA for these sub-corpora.
The x-axis shows the number of transliterators used
to form the sub-corpora. For example, when x = 3,
the performance figures plotted are achieved on cor-
pora when taking all triples of the seven translitera-
tor’s transliterations.

From the boxplots it can be seen that performance
varies considerably when the number of transliter-
ators used to determine a majority vote is varied.

Figure 3: Performance on sub-corpora derived by combining the number of transliterators shown on the x-
axis. Boxes show the 25th and 75th percentile of the MWA for all 7Cx combinations of transliterators using
SYS-2, with whiskers showing extreme values.

However, the changes do not follow a fixed trend
across the languages. For E7, the range of accuracies
achieved is high when only two or three translitera-
tors are involved, ranging from 37.0% to 50.6% in
SYS-2 method and from 33.8% to 48.0% in SYS-1
(not shown) when only two transliterators’ data are
available. When more than three transliterators are
used, the range of performance is noticeably smaller.
Hence if at least four transliterators are used, then it
is more likely that a system’s MWA will be stable.
This finding is supported by Papineni et al. (2002)
who recommend that four people should be used for
collecting judgments for machine translation exper-
iments.

The corpora derived from A7 show consistent me-
dian increases as the number of transliterators in-
creases, but the median accuracy is lower than for
other languages. The D7 collection does not show
any stable results until at least six transliterator’s are
used.

The results indicate that creating a collection used
for the evaluation of transliteration systems, based
on a “gold standard” created by only one human
transliterator may lead to word accuracy results that
could show a 10% absolute difference compared to
results on a corpus derived using a different translit-

erator. This is evidenced by the leftmost box in each
panel of the figure which has a wide range of results.

Figure 4 shows this box in more detail for each
collection, plotting the word accuracy for each
user for all sub-corpora for SYS-2. The accuracy
achieved varies significantly between translitera-
tors; for example, for E7 collections, word accuracy
varies from 37.2% for T1 to 50.0% for T5. This
variance is more obvious for the D7 dataset where
the difference ranges from 23.2% for T 1 to 56.2%
for T 3. Origin language also has an effect: accuracy
for the Arabic collection (A7) is generally less than
that of English (E7). The Dutch collection (D7),
shows an unstable trend across transliterators. In
other words, accuracy differs in a narrower range for
Arabic and English, but in wider range for Dutch.

644



This is likely due to the fact that most transliterators
found Dutch a difficult language to work with, as
reported in Table 1.

3.1 Transliterator Consistency

To investigate the effect of invididual transliterator
consistency on system accuracy, we consider the
number of Persian characters used by each transliter-
ator on each sub-corpus, and the average number of
rules generated by SYS-2 on the ten training sets de-
rived in the ten-fold cross validation process, which
are shown in Table 2. For example, when translit-
erating words from E7 into Persian, T3 only ever
used 21 out of 32 characters available in the Persian
alphabet; T7, on the other hand, used 24 different
Persian characters. It is expected that an increase in
number of characters or rules provides more “noise”
for the automated system, hence may lead to lower
accuracy. Superficially the opposite seems true for
rules: the mean number of rules generated by SYS-
2 is much higher for the EDA7 corpus than for the A7
corpus, and yet Figure 1 shows that word accuracy
is higher on the EDA7 corpus. A correlation test,
however, reveals that there is no significant relation-
ship between either the number of characters used,
nor the number of rules generated, and the result-
ing word accuracy of SYS-2 (Spearman correlation,
p = 0.09 (characters) and p = 0.98 (rules)).

A better indication of “noise” in the corpus may
be given by the consistency with which a translit-
erator applies a certain rule. For example, a large
number of rules generated from a particular translit-
erator’s corpus may not be problematic if many of
the rules get applied with a low probability. If, on
the other hand, there were many rules with approx-
imately equal probabilities, the system may have
difficulty distinguishing when to apply some rules,
and not others. One way to quantify this effect
is to compute the self entropy of the rule distribu-
tion for each segment in the corpus for an indi-
vidual. If pi j is the probability of applying rule
1 ≤ j ≤ m when confronted with source segment
i, then Hi = −∑mj=1 pi j log2 pi j is the entropy of the
probability distribution for that rule. H is maximized
when the probabilities pi j are all equal, and mini-
mized when the probabilities are very skewed (Shan-
non, 1948). As an example, consider the rules:
t →< �H,0.5 >, t →< ,0.3 > and t →<X,0.2 >; for

which Ht = 0.79.
The expected entropy can be used to obtain a sin-

gle entropy value over the whole corpus,

E =−
R

∑
i=1

fi
S

Hi,

where Hi is the entropy of the rule probabilities for
segment i, R is the total number of segments, fi is
the frequency with which segment i occurs at any
position in all source words in the corpus, and S is
the sum of all fi.

The expected entropy for each transliterator is
shown in Figure 5, separated by corpus. Compar-
ison of this graph with Figure 4 shows that gen-
erally transliterators that have used rules inconsis-
tently generate a corpus that leads to low accuracy
for the systems. For example, T1 who has the low-
est accuracy for all the collections in both methods,
also has the highest expected entropy of rules for
all the collections. For the E7 collection, the max-
imum accuracy of 50.0%, belongs to T 5 who has
the minimum expected entropy. The same applies
to the D7 collection, where the maximum accuracy
of 56.2% and the minimum expected entropy both
belong to T 3. These observations are confirmed
by a statistically significant Spearman correlation
between expected rule entropy and word accuracy
(r = −0.54, p = 0.003). Therefore, the consistency
with which transliterators employ their own internal
rules in developing a corpus has a direct effect on
system performance measures.

3.2 Inter-Transliterator Agreement and
Perceived Difficulty

Here we present various agreement proportions (PA
from Section 2.2), which give a measure of consis-
tency in the corpora across all users, as opposed to
the entropy measure which gives a consistency mea-
sure for a single user. For E7, PA was 33.6%, for
A7 it was 33.3% and for D7, agreement was 15.5%.
In general, humans agree less than 33% of the time
when transliterating English to Persian.

In addition, we examined agreement among
transliterators based on their perception of the task
difficulty shown in Table 1. For A7, agreement
among those who found the task easy was higher
(22.3%) than those who found it in medium level

(18.8%). PA is 12.0% for those who found the
D7 collection hard to transliterate; while the six
transliterators who found the E7 collection difficulty
medium had PA = 30.2%. Hence, the harder par-
ticipants rated the transliteration task, the lower the
agreement scores tend to be for the derived corpus.

Finally, in Table 3 we show word accuracy results
for the two systems on corpora derived from translit-
erators grouped by perceived level of difficulty on
A7. It is readily apparent that SYS-2 outperforms
SYS-1 on the corpus comprised of human translit-
erations from people who saw the task as easy with
both word accuracy metrics; the relative improve-
ment of over 50% is statistically significant (paired
t-test on ten-fold cross validation runs). However,
on the corpus composed of transliterations that were
perceived as more difficult, “Medium”, the advan-
tage of SYS-2 is significantly eroded, but is still
statistically significant for UWA. Here again, using
only one transliteration, MWA, did not distinguish
the performance of each system.

4 Discussion

We have evaluated two English to Persian translit-
eration systems on a variety of controlled corpora
using evaluation metrics that appear in previous
transliteration studies. Varying the evaluation cor-
pus in a controlled fashion has revealed several in-
teresting facts.

We report that human agreement on the English

fect that this level of disagreement on the evalua-
tion of systems has, can be seen in Figure 4, where
word accuracy is computed on corpora derived from
single transliterators. Accuracy can vary by up to
30% in absolute terms depending on the translitera-
tor chosen. To our knowledge, this is the first paper

to report human agreement, and examine its effects
on transliteration accuracy.

In order to alleviate some of these effects on the
stability of word accuracy measures across corpora,
we recommend that at least four transliterators are
used to construct a corpus. Figure 3 shows that con-
structing a corpus with four or more transliterators,
the range of possible word accuracies achieved is
less than that of using fewer transliterators.

Some past studies do not use more than a sin-
gle target word for every source word in the cor-
pus (Bilac and Tanaka, 2005; Oh and Choi, 2006).
Our results indicate that it is unlikely that these re-
sults would translate onto a corpus other than the
one used in these studies, except in rare cases where
human transliterators are in 100% agreement for a
given language pair.

Given the nature of the English language, an En-
glish corpus can contain English words from a vari-
ety of different origins. In this study we have used
English words from an Arabic and Dutch origin to
show that word accuracy of the systems can vary by
up to 25% (in absolute terms) depending on the ori-
gin of English words in the corpus, as demonstrated
in Figure 1.

In addition to computing agreement, we also in-

vestigated the transliterator’s perception of difficulty
of the transliteration task with the ensuing word ac-
curacy of the systems. Interestingly, when using cor-
pora built from transliterators that perceive the task
to be easy, there is a large difference in the word
accuracy between the two systems, but on corpora
built from transliterators who perceive the task to be
more difficult, the gap between the systems narrows.
Hence, a corpus applied for evaluation of transliter-
ation should either be made carefully with translit-
erators with a variety of backgrounds, or should be
large enough and be gathered from various sources
so as to simulate different expectations of its ex-
pected non-homogeneous users.

The self entropy of rule probability distributions
derived by the automated transliteration system can
be used to measure the consistency with which in-
dividual transliterators apply their own rules in con-
structing a corpus. It was demonstrated that when
systems are evaluated on corpora built by transliter-
ators who are less consistent in their application of
transliteration rules, word accuracy is reduced.

Given the large variations in system accuracy that
are demonstrated by the varying corpora used in this
study, we recommend that extreme care be taken
when constructing corpora for evaluating translitera-
tion systems. Studies should also give details of their
corpora that would allow any of the effects observed
in this paper to be taken into account.
