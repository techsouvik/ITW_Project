Abstract

Current research in text mining favours the
quantity of texts over their quality. But for
bilingual terminology mining, and for many
language pairs, large comparable corpora
are not available. More importantly, as terms
are defined vis-à-vis a specific domain with
a restricted register, it is expected that the
quality rather than the quantity of the corpus
matters more in terminology mining. Our
hypothesis, therefore, is that the quality of
the corpus is more important than the quan-
tity and ensures the quality of the acquired
terminological resources. We show how im-
portant the type of discourse is as a charac-
teristic of the comparable corpus.

1 Introduction

Two main approaches exist for compiling corpora:
“Big is beautiful” or “Insecurity in large collec-
tions”. Text mining research commonly adopts the
first approach and favors data quantity over qual-
ity. This is normally justified on the one hand by
the need for large amounts of data in order to make
use of statistic or stochastic methods (Manning and
Schütze, 1999), and on the other by the lack of oper-
ational methods to automatize the building of a cor-
pus answering to selected criteria, such as domain,
register, media, style or discourse.

For lexical alignment from comparable corpora,
good results on single words can be obtained from
large corpora — several millions words — the accu-
racy of proposed translation is about 80% for the top
10-20 candidates (Fung, 1998; Rapp, 1999; Chiao
and Zweigenbaum, 2002). (Cao and Li, 2002) have
achieved 91% accuracy for the top three candidates
using the Web as a comparable corpus. But for spe-
cific domains, and many pairs of languages, such
huge corpora are not available. More importantly,
as terms are defined vis-à-vis a specific domain with
a restricted register, it is expected that the quality
rather than the quantity of the corpus matters more in
terminology mining. For terminology mining, there-
fore, our hypothesis is that the quality of the corpora
is more important than the quantity and that this en-
sures the quality of the acquired terminological re-
sources.

Comparable corpora are “sets of texts in different
languages, that are not translations of each other”
(Bowker and Pearson, 2002, p. 93). The term com-
parable is used to indicate that these texts share
some characteristics or features: topic, period, me-
dia, author, register (Biber, 1994), discourse... This
corpus comparability is discussed by lexical align-
ment researchers but never demonstrated: it is of-
ten reduced to a specific domain, such as the med-
ical (Chiao and Zweigenbaum, 2002) or financial
domains (Fung, 1998), or to a register, such as
newspaper articles (Fung, 1998). For terminology

664



mining, the comparability of the corpus should be
based on the domain or the sub-domaine, but also
on the type of discourse. Indeed, discourse acts
semantically upon the lexical units. For a defined
topic, some terms are specific to one discourse or
another. For example, for French, within the sub-
domain of obesity in the domain of medicine, we
find the term excès de poids (overweight) only in-
side texts sharing a popular science discourse, and
the synonym excès pondéral (overweight) only in
scientific discourse. In order to evaluate how impor-
tant the discourse criterion is for building bilingual
terminological lists, we carried out experiments on
French-Japanese comparable corpora in the domain
of medicine, more precisely on the topic of diabetes
and nutrition, using texts collected from the Web and
manually selected and classified into two discourse
categories: one contains only scientific documents
and the other contains both scientific and popular
science documents.

We used a state-of-the-art multilingual terminol-
ogy mining chain composed of two term extraction
programs, one in each language, and an alignment
program. The term extraction programs are pub-
licly available and both extract multi-word terms
that are more precise and specific to a particular sci-
entific domain than single word terms. The align-
ment program makes use of the direct context-vector
approach (Fung, 1998; Peters and Picchi, 1998;
Rapp, 1999) slightly modified to handle both single-
and multi-word terms. We evaluated the candidate
translations of multi-word terms using a reference
list compiled from publicly available resources. We
found that taking discourse type into account re-
sulted in candidate translations of a better quality
even when the corpus size is reduced by half. Thus,
even using a state-of-the-art alignment method well-
known as data greedy, we reached the conclusion
that the quantity of data is not sufficient to obtain
a terminological list of high quality and that a real
comparability of corpora is required.

2 Multilingual terminology mining chain

Taking as input a comparable corpora, the multilin-
gual terminology chain outputs a list of single- and
multi-word candidate terms along with their candi-
date translations. Its architecture is summarized in

Figure 1 and comprises term extraction and align-
ment programs.

2.1 Term extraction programs

The terminology extraction programs are avail-
able for both French1 (Daille, 2003) and Japanese2

(Takeuchi et al., 2004). The terminological units
that are extracted are multi-word terms whose syn-
tactic patterns correspond either to a canonical or a
variation structure. The patterns are expressed us-
ing part-of-speech tags: for French, Brill’s POS tag-
ger3 and the FLEM lemmatiser4 are utilised, and for
Japanese, CHASEN5. For French, the main patterns
are N N, N Prep N et N Adj and for Japanese, N N,
N Suff, Adj N and Pref N. The variants handled are
morphological for both languages, syntactical only
for French, and compounding only for Japanese. We
consider as a morphological variant a morphological
modification of one of the components of the base
form, as a syntactical variant the insertion of another
word into the components of the base form, and as
a compounding variant the agglutination of another
word to one of the components of the base form. For
example, in French, the candidate MWT sécrétion
d’insuline (insulin secretion) appears in the follow-
ing forms:

� base form of N Prep N pattern: sécrétion
d’insuline (insulin secretion);

� inflexional variant: sécrétions d’insuline (in-
sulin secretions);

� syntactic variant (insertion inside the base
form of a modifier): sécrétion pancréatique
d’insuline (pancreatic insulin secretion);

� syntactic variant (expansion coordination of
base form): secrétion de peptide et d’insuline
(insulin and peptide secretion).

The MWT candidates secrétion insulinique (insulin
secretion) and hypersécrétion insulinique (insulin

At present, the Japanese term extraction program
does not cluster terms.

2.2 Term alignment

The lexical alignment program adapts the direct
context-vector approach proposed by (Fung, 1998)
for single-word terms (SWTs) to multi-word terms
(MWTs). It aligns source MWTs with target single

pound into its component parts through the use of the “.” sym-
bol.

words, SWTs or MWTs. From now on, we will refer
to lexical units as words, SWTs or MWTs.

2.2.1 Implementation of the direct
context-vector method

Our implementation of the direct context-vector
method consists of the following 4 steps:

1. We collect all the lexical units in the context of
each lexical unit � and count their occurrence
frequency in a window of � words around � .
For each lexical unit � of the source and the
target language, we obtain a context vector ���
which gathers the set of co-occurrence units �
associated with the number of times that � and �
occur together � �!� �" . We normalise context vec-
tors using an association score such as Mutual
Information or Log-likelihood. In order to re-
duce the arity of context vectors, we keep only
the co-occurrences with the highest association
scores.

2. Using a bilingual dictionary, we translate the
lexical units of the source context vector.

666



3. For a word to be translated, we compute the
similarity between the translated context vector
and all target vectors through vector distance
measures such as Cosine (Salton and Lesk,
1968) or Jaccard (Tanimoto, 1958).

4. The candidate translations of a lexical unit are
the target lexical units closest to the translated
context vector according to vector distance.

2.2.2 Translation of lexical units

The translation of the lexical units of the context
vectors, which depends on the coverage of the bilin-
gual dictionary vis-à-vis the corpus, is an important
step of the direct approach: more elements of the
context vector are translated more the context vector
will be discrimating for selecting translations in the
target language. If the bilingual dictionary provides
several translations for a lexical unit, we consider all
of them but weight the different translations by their
frequency in the target language. If an MWT cannot
be directly translated, we generate possible trans-
lations by using a compositional method (Grefen-
stette, 1999). For each element of the MWT found
in the bilingual dictionary, we generate all the trans-
lated combinations identified by the term extraction
program. For example, in the case of the MWT fa-
tigue chronique (chronic fatigue), we have the fol-
lowing four translations for fatigue: ��� , ��� ,���

, �
	 and the following two translations for
chronique: ������ , ��� . Next, we generate all
combinations of translated elements (See Table 17)
and select those which refer to an existing MWT
in the target language. Here, only one term has
been identified by the Japanese terminology extrac-
tion program: ��� . ��� . In this approach, when
it is not possible to translate all parts of an MWT,
or when the translated combinations are not identi-
fied by the term extraction program, the MWT is not
taken into account in the translation process.

This approach differs from that used by (Ro-
bitaille et al., 2006) for French/Japanese translation.
They first decompose the French MWT into com-
binations of shorter multi-word units (MWU) ele-
ments. This approach makes the direct translation of
a subpart of the MWT possible if it is present in the

bilingual dictionary. For an MWT of length � , (Ro-
bitaille et al., 2006) produce all the combinations of
MWU elements of a length less than or equal to � .
For example, the French term syndrome de fatigue
chronique (chronic fatigue disease) yields the fol-
lowing four combinations: i) � syndrome de fatigue
chronique � , ii) � syndrome de fatigue ��� chronique � , iii)
� syndrome ��� fatigue chronique � and iv) � syndrome �
� fatigue ��� chronique � . We limit ourselves to the com-
bination of type iv) above since 90% of the candidate
terms provided by the term extraction process, after
clustering, are only composed of two content words.

3 Linguistic resources

In this section we outline the different textual re-
sources used for our experiments: the comparable
corpora, bilingual dictionary and reference lexicon.

3.1 Comparable corpora

The French and Japanese documents were harvested
from the Web by native speakers of each language
who are not domain specialists. The texts are from
the medical domain, within the sub-domain of dia-
betes and nutrition. Document harvesting was car-
ried out by a domain-based search, then by man-
ual selection. The search for documents sharing the
same domain can be achieved using keywords re-
flecting the specialized domain: for French, diabète
and obésité (diabetes and obesity); for Japanese,  !�"

and #$ . Then the documents were classified
according to the type of discourse: scientific or pop-
ularized science. At present, the selection and clas-
sification phases are carried out manually although

667



research into how to automatize these two steps is
ongoing. Table 2 shows the main features of the
harvested comparable corpora: the number of doc-
uments, and the number of words for each language
and each type of discourse.

Table 2: Comparable corpora statistics

From these documents, we created two compara-
ble corpora:

� � scientific corpora � , composed only of scientific
documents;

� �mixed corpora � , composed of both popular and
scientific documents.

3.2 Bilingual dictionary

The French-Japanese bilingual dictionary required
for the translation phase is composed of four dic-
tionaries freely available from the Web8, and of
the French-Japanese Scientific Dictionary (1989).
It contains about 173,156 entries (114,461 single
words and 58,695 multi words) with an average of
2.1 translations per entry.

3.3 Terminology reference lists

To evaluate the quality of the terminology min-
ing chain, we built two bilingual terminology refer-
ence lists which include either SWTs or SMTs and
MWTs:

� � lexicon 1 � 100 French SWTs of which the
translation are Japanese SWTs.

� � lexicon 2 � 60 French SWTs and MWTs of
which the translation could be Japanese SWTs
or MWTs.

index&d=25, http://dico.fj.free.fr/index.
php, http://quebec-japon.com/lexique/index.
php?a=index&d=3

These lexicons contains terms that occur at least
twice in the scientific corpus, have been identified
monolingually by both the French and the Japanese
term extraction programs, and are found in either
the UMLS9 thesaurus or in the French part of the
Grand dictionnaire terminologique10 in the domain
of medicine. These constraints prevented us from
obtaining 100 French SWTs and MWTs for lexicon
2. The main reasons for this are the small number
of UMLS terms dealing with the sub-domain of di-
abetes and the great difference between the linguis-
tic structures of French and Japanese terms: French
pattern definitions tend to cover more phrasal units
while Japanese pattern definitions focus more nar-
rowly on compounds. So, even if monolingually
the same percentage of terms are detected in both
languages, this does not guarantee a good result in
bilingual terminology extraction. For example, the
French term diabète de type 1 (Diabetes mellitus
type I) extracted by the French term extraction pro-
gram and found in UMLS was not extracted by the
Japanese term extraction program although it ap-
pears frequently in the Japanese corpus ( �

�  ! "
).

In bilingual terminology mining from specialized
comparable corpora, the terminology reference lists
are often composed of a hundred words (180 SWTs
in (Déjean and Gaussier, 2002) and 97 SWTs in
(Chiao and Zweigenbaum, 2002)).

4 Experiments

In order to evaluate the influence of discourse type
on the quality of bilingual terminology extraction,
two experiments were carried out. Since the main
studies relating to bilingual lexicon extraction from
comparable corpora concentrate on finding transla-
tion candidates for SWTs, we first perform an ex-
periment using � lexicon 1 � , which is composed of
SWTs. In order to evaluate the hypothesis of this
study, we then conducted a second experiment using
� lexicon 2 � , which is composed of MWTs.

tions in the ranked list of candidate translations.
The other two columns indicate the percentage of
French terms for which the correct translation was
obtained among the top ten and top twenty candi-
dates (

����! �$# , � �"! ��# ).
The results of this experiment (see Table 3) show

that the terms belonging to � lexicon 1 � were more
easily identified in the corpus of scientific and pop-
ular documents (51% and 60% respectively for� �"! �$# and � ��! ��# ) than in the corpus of scien-
tific documents (49% and 52%). Since � lexicon 1 � is
composed of SWTs, these terms are not more char-
acteristic of popular discourse than scientific dis-
course.

The frequency of the terms to be translated is an
important factor in the vectorial approach. In fact,
the higher the frequency of the term to be translated,
the more the associated context vector will be dis-
criminant. Table 5 confirms this hypothesis since
the most frequent terms, such as insuline (#occ. 364
- insulin:

��� � � �
), obésité (#occ. 333 - obe-

sity: #$ ), and prévention (#occ. 120 - prevention:(*)
), were the best translated.

lated belonging to � lexicon 1 � (for � �"! ��# )

As a baseline, (Déjean et al., 2002) obtain 43%
and 51% for the first 10 and 20 candidates respec-
tively in a 100,000-word medical corpus, and 79%
and 84% in a multi-domain 8 million-word cor-
pus. For single-item French-English words applied
on a medical corpus of 0.66 million words, (Chiao
and Zweigenbaum, 2002) obtained 61% and 94%
precision on the top-10 and top-20 candidates. In
our case, we obtained 51% and 60% precision for
the top 10 and 20 candidates in a 1.5 million-word
French/Japanese corpus.

4.2 Alignment results for � lexicon 2 �
The analysis results in table 4 indicate only a small
number of the terms in � lexicon 2 � were found.
Since we work with small-size corpora, this result
is not surprising. Because multi-word terms are
more specific than single-word terms, they tend to
occur less frequently in a corpus and are more diffi-
cult to translate. Here, the terms belonging � lexicon
2 � were more accurately identified from the corpus
which consists of scientific documents than the cor-
pus which consists of scientific and popular doc-
uments. In this instance, we obtained 30% and
42% precision for the top 10 and top 20 candi-
dates in a 0.84 million-word scientific corpus. More-
over, if we count the number of terms which are
correctly translated between � scientific corpora � and
�mixed corpora � , we find the majority of the trans-
lated terms with �mixed corpora � in those obtained
with � scientific corpora � 11 By combining parameters

such as the window size of the context vector, as-

5 Conclusion

This article describes a first attempt at compiling
French-Japanese terminology from comparable cor-
pora taking into account both single- and multi-word
terms. Our claim was that a real comparability of
the corpora is required to obtain relevant terms of
the domain. This comparability should be based not
only on the domain and the sub-domain but also on
the type of discourse, which acts semantically upon
the lexical units. The discourse categorization of
documents allows lexical acquisition to increase pre-

670



cision despite the data sparsity problem that is of-
ten encountered for terminology mining and for lan-
guage pairs not involving the English language, such
as French-Japanese. We carried out experiments us-
ing two corpora of the specialised domain concern-
ing diabetes and nutrition: one gathering documents
from both scientific and popular science discourses,
the other limited to scientific discourse. Our align-
ment results are close to previous works involving
the English language, and are of better quality for
the scientific corpus despite a corpus size that was
reduced by half. The results demonstrate that the
more frequent a term and its translation, the better
the quality of the alignment will be, but also that the
data sparsity problem could be partially solved by
using comparable corpora of high quality.
