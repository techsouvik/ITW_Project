Abstract

We examine the effect of contextual and
acoustic cues in the disambiguation of three
discourse-pragmatic functions of the word
okay. Results of a perception study show
that contextual cues are stronger predictors
of discourse function than acoustic cues.
However, acoustic features capturing the
pitch excursion at the right edge of okay fea-
ture prominently in disambiguation, whether
other contextual cues are present or not.

1 Introduction

CUE PHRASES (also known as DISCOURSE MARK-
ERS) are linguistic expressions that can be used to
convey explicit information about the structure of
a discourse or to convey a semantic contribution
(Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Reichman, 1985; Cohen,
1984). For example, the word okay can be used to
convey a ‘satisfactory’ evaluation of some entity in
the discourse (the movie was okay); as a backchan-
nel in a dialogue to indicate that one interlocutor
is still attending to another; to convey acknowledg-
ment or agreement; or, in its ‘cue’ use, to start or fin-
ish a discourse segment (Jefferson, 1972; Schegloff
and Sacks, 1973; Kowtko, 1997; Ward and Tsuka-
hara, 2000). A major question is how speakers indi-
cate and listeners interpret such variation in mean-
ing. From a practical perspective, understanding
how speakers and listeners disambiguate cue phrases
is important to spoken dialogue systems, so that sys-
tems can convey potentially ambiguous terms with
their intended meaning and can interpret user input
correctly.

There is considerable evidence that the different

uses of individual cue phrases can be distinguished
by variation in the prosody with which they are re-
alized. For example, (Hirschberg and Litman, 1993)
found that cue phrases in general could be disam-
biguated between their ‘semantic’ and their ‘dis-
course marker’ uses in terms of the type of pitch
accent borne by the cue phrase, the position of the
phrase in the intonational phrase, and the amount
of additional information in the phrase. Despite the
frequence of the word okay in natural dialogues,
relatively little attention has been paid to the rela-
tionship between its use and its prosodic realization.
(Hockey, 1993) did find that okay differs in terms of
the pitch contour speakers use in uttering it, suggest-
ing that a final rising pitch contour “categorically
marks a turn change,” while a downstepped falling
pitch contour usually indicates a discourse segment
boundary. However, it is not clear which, if any, of
the prosodic differences identified in this study are
actually used by listeners in interpreting these po-
tentially ambiguous items.

In this study, we address the question of how hear-
ers disambiguate the interpretation of okay. Our goal
is to identify the acoustic, prosodic and phonetic fea-
tures of okay tokens for which listeners assign differ-
ent meanings. Additionally, we want to determine
the role that discourse context plays in this classi-
fication: i.e., can subjects classify okay tokens reli-
ably from the word alone or do they require addi-
tional context?

Below we describe a perception study in which
listeners were presented with a number of spoken
productions of okay, taken from a corpus of dia-
logues between subjects playing a computer game.
The tokens were presented both in isolation and in
context. Users were asked to select the meaning

800



of each token from three of the meanings that okay
can take on: ACKNOWLEDGEMENT/AGREEMENT,
BACKCHANNEL, and CUE OF AN INITIAL DIS-
COURSE SEGMENT. Subsequently, we examined the
acoustic, prosodic and phonetic correlates of these
classifications to try to infer what cues listeners used
to interpret the tokens, and how these varied by con-
text condition. Section 2 describes our corpus. Sec-
tion 3 describes the perception experiment. In Sec-
tion 4 we analyze inter-subject agreement, introduce
a novel representation of subject judgments, and ex-
amine the acoustic, prosodic, phonetic and contex-
tual correlates of subject classification of okays. In
Section 5 we discuss our results and future work.

2 Corpus

The materials for our perception study were selected
from a portion of the Columbia Games Corpus, a
collection of 12 spontaneous task-oriented dyadic
conversations elicited from speakers of Standard
American English. The corpus was collected and
annotated jointly by the Spoken Language Group
at Columbia University and the Department of Lin-
guistics at Northwestern University.

Subjects were paid to play two series of com-
puter games (the CARDS GAMES and the OBJECTS
GAMES), requiring collaboration between partners
to achieve a common goal. Participants sat in front
of laptops in a soundproof booth with a curtain be-
tween them, so that all communication would be ver-
bal. Each player played with two different partners
in two different sessions. On average, each session
took 45m 39s, totalling 9h 8m of dialogue for the
whole corpus. All interactions were recorded, digi-
tized, and downsampled to 16K.

The recordings were orthographically transcribed
and words were aligned by hand by trained annota-
tors in a ToBI (Beckman and Hirschberg, 1994) or-
thographic tier using Praat (Boersma and Weenink,
2001) to manipulate waveforms. The corpus con-
tains 2239 unique words, with 73,831 words in total.
Nearly all of the Objects Games part of the corpus
has been intonationally transcribed, using the ToBI
conventions. Pitch, energy and duration information
has been extracted for the entire corpus automati-
cally, using Praat.

In the Objects Games portion of the corpus each

player’s laptop displayed a gameboard containing 5–
7 objects (Figure 1). In each segment of the game,
both players saw the same set of objects at the same
position on each screen, except for one object (the
TARGET). For one player (the DESCRIBER), this tar-
get appeared in a random location among other ob-
jects on the screen. For the other player (the FOL-
LOWER), the target object appeared at the bottom of
the screen. The describer was instructed to describe
the position of the target object on their screen so
that the follower could move their representation of
the target to the same location on their own screen.
After the players had negotiated what they deter-
mined to be the best location, they were awarded
up to 100 points based on the actual match of the
target location on the two screens. The game pro-
ceeded in this way through 14 tasks, with describer
and follower alternating roles. On average, the Ob-
jects Games portion of each session took 21m 36s,
resulting in 4h 19m of dialogue for the twelve ses-
sions in the corpus. There are 1484 unique words in
this portion of the corpus, and 36,503 words in total.

Figure 1: Sample screen of the Objects Games.

Throughout the Objects Games, we noted that
subjects made frequent use of affirmative cue words,
such as okay, yeah, alright, which appeared to vary
in meaning. To investigate the discourse functions
of such words, we first asked three labelers to inde-
pendently classify all occurrences of alright, gotcha,
huh, mmhm, okay, right, uhhuh, yeah, yep, yes, yup
in the entire Games Corpus into one of ten cate-
gories, including acknowledgment/agreement, cue
beginning or ending discourse segment, backchan-
nel, and literal modifier. Labelers were asked to

801



choose the most appropriate category for each to-
ken, or indicate with ‘?’ if they could not make a
decision. They were allowed to read the transcripts
and listen to the speech as they labeled.

For our perception experiment we chose materials
from the tokens of the most frequent of our labeled
affirmative words, okay, from the Objects Games,
which contained most of these tokens. Altogether,
there are 1151 instances of okay in this part of the
corpus; it is the third most frequent word, follow-
ing the, with 4565 instances, and of, with 1534.
At least two labelers agreed on the functional cat-
egory of 902 (78%) okay tokens. Of those tokens,
286 (32%) were classified as BACKCHANNEL, 255
(28%) as ACKNOWLEDGEMENT/AGREEMENT, 141
(16%) as CUE BEGINNING, 116 (13%) as PIVOT
BEGINNING (a function that combines Acknowl-
edgement/agreement and Cue beginning), and 104
(11%) as one of the other functions. We sampled
from tokens the annotators had labeled as Cue be-
ginning discourse segment, Backchannel, and Ac-
knowledgement/agreement, the most frequent cate-
gories in the corpus; we will refer to these below
simply as ‘C’, ‘B’, and ‘A’ classes, respectively.

3 Experiment

We next designed a perception experiment to ex-
amine naive subjects’ perception of these tokens of
okay. To obtain good coverage both of the (labeled)
A, B, and C classes, as well as the degrees of po-
tential ambiguity among these classes, we identified
9 categories of okay tokens to include in the experi-
ment: 3 classes (A, B, C) × 3 levels of labeler agree-
ment (UNANIMOUS, MAJORITY, NO-AGREEMENT).
‘Unanimous’ refers to tokens assigned to a particu-
lar class label by all 3 labelers, ‘majority’ to tokens
assigned to this class by 2 of the 3 labelers, and ‘no-
agreement’ to tokens assigned to this class by only
1 labeler. To decrease variability in the stimuli, we
selected tokens only from speakers who produced at
least one token for each of the 9 conditions. There
were 6 such speakers (3 female, 3 male), which gave
us a total of 54 tokens.

To see whether subjects’ classifications of okay
were dependent upon contextual information or not,
we prepared two versions of each token. The iso-
lated versions consisted of only the word okay ex-

tracted from the waveform. For the contextualized
versions, we extracted two full speaker turns for
each okay including the full turn1 containing the tar-
get okay plus the full turn of the previous speaker. In
the following three sample contexts, pauses are indi-
cated with ‘#’, and the target okays are underlined:
Speaker A: yeah # um there’s like there’s some space there’s
Speaker B: okay # I think I got it

Speaker A: but it’s gonna be below the onion
Speaker B: okay

Speaker A: okay # alright # I’ll try it # okay
Speaker B: okay the owl is blinking

The isolated okay tokens were single channel au-
dio files; the contextualized okay tokens were for-
matted so that each speaker was presented to sub-
jects on a different channel, with the speaker uttering
the target okay consistently on the same channel.

The perception study was divided into two parts.
In the first part, each subject was presented with
the 54 isolated okay tokens, in a different ran-
dom ordering for each subject. They were given
a forced choice task to classify them as A, B, or
C, with the corresponding labels (Acknowledge-
ment/agreement, Backchannel, and Cue beginning)
also presented in a random order for each token. In
the second part, the same subject was given 54 con-
textualized tokens, presented in a different random
order, and asked to make the same choice.

We recruited 20 (paid) subjects for the study, 10
female, and 10 male, all between the ages of 20 and
60. All subjects were native speakers of Standard
American English, except for one subject who was
born in Jamaica but a native speaker of English. All
subjects reported no hearing problems. Subjects per-
formed the study in a quiet lab using headphones to
listen to the tokens and indicating their classification
decisions in a GUI interface on a lab workstation.
They were given instructions on how to use the in-
terface before each of the two sections of the study.

For the study itself, for each token in the isolated
condition, subjects were shown a screen with the
three randomly ordered classes and a link to the to-
ken’s sound file. They could listen to the sound files
as many times as they wished but were instructed
not to be concerned with answering the questions

1We define a TURN as a maximal sequence of words spoken
by the same speaker during which the speaker holds the floor.

“correctly”, but to answer with their immediate re-
sponse if possible. However, they were allowed to
change their selection as many times as they liked
before moving to the next screen. In the contex-
tualized condition, they were also shown an ortho-
graphic transcription of part of the contextualized to-
ken, to help them identify the target okay. The mean
duration of the first part of the study was 25 minutes,
and of the second part, 27 minutes.

4 Results

4.1 Subject ratings

The distribution of class labels in each experimental
condition is shown in Table 1. While this distribu-
tion roughly mirrors our selection of equal numbers
of tokens from each previously-labeled class, in both
parts of the study more tokens were labeled as A
(acknowledgment/agreement) than as B (backchan-
nel) or C (cue to topic beginning). This supports
the hypothesis that acknowledgment/agreement may
function as the default interpretation of okay.

B 324 (30%) 306 (28%)
C 330 (31%) 322 (30%)

Total 1080 (100%) 1080 (100%)

Table 1: Distribution of label classes in each
study condition.

We examined inter-subject agreement using
Fleiss’ κ measure of inter-rater agreement for mul-
tiple raters (Fleiss, 1971).2 Table 2 shows Fleiss’ κ
calculated for each individual label vs. the other two
labels and for all three labels, in both study condi-
tions. From this table we see that, while there is very
little overall agreement among subjects about how
to classify tokens in the isolated condition, agree-
ment is higher in the contextualized condition, with
a moderate agreement for class C (κ score of .497).
This suggests that context helps distinguish the cue
beginning discourse segment function more than the
other two functions of okay.

2 This measure of agreement above chance is interpreted as
follows: 0 = None, 0 - 0.2 = Small, 0.2 - 0.4 = Fair, 0.4 - 0.6 =
Moderate, 0.6 - 0.8 = Substantial, 0.8 - 1 = Almost perfect.

Recall from Section 3 that the okay tokens were
chosen in equal numbers from three classes accord-
ing to the level of agreement of our three original
labelers (unanimous, majority, and no-agreement),
who had the full dialogue context to use in making
their decisions. Table 3 shows Fleiss’ κ measure
now grouped by amount of agreement of the orig-
inal labelers, again presented for each context con-
dition. We see here that the inter-subject agreement

also mirrors the agreement of the three original la-
belers. In both study conditions, tokens which the
original labelers agreed on also had the highest κ
scores, followed by tokens in the majority and no-
agreement classes, in that order. In all cases, tokens
which subjects heard in context showed more agree-
ment than those they heard in isolation.

The overall κ is small at .120 for the isolated con-
dition, and fair at .293 for the contextualized con-
dition. The three original labelers also achieved fair
agreement at .312.3 The similarity between the lat-
ter two κ scores suggests that the full context avail-
able to the original labelers and the limited context
presented to the experiment subjets offer compara-
ble amounts of information to disambiguate between
the three functions, although lack of any context
clearly affected subjects’ decisions. We conclude

3 For the calculation of this κ, we considered four label
classes: A, B, C, and a fourth class ‘other’ that comprises the
remaining 7 word functions mentioned in Section 2. In conse-
quence, these κ scores should be compared with caution.

803



from these results that context is of considerable im-
portance in the interpretation of the word okay, al-
though even a very limited context appears to suf-
fice.

4.2 Representing subject judgments

In this section, we present a graphical representa-
tion of subject decisions, useful for interpreting, vi-
sualizing, and comparing the way our subjects in-
terpreted the different tokens of okay. For each in-
dividual okay in the study, we define an associated
three-dimensional VOTE VECTOR, whose compo-
nents are the proportions of subjects that classified
the token as A, B or C. For example, if a particu-
lar okay was labeled as A by 5 subjects, as B by 3,
and as C by 12, then its associated vote vector is
(

5

20
, 3

20
, 12

)

= (0.25, 0.15, 0.6). Following this def-
inition, the vectors A = (1, 0, 0), B = (0, 1, 0) and
C = (0, 0, 1) correspond to the ideal situations in
which all 20 subjects agreed on the label. We call
these vectors the UNANIMOUS-VOTE VECTORS.

Figure 2.i shows a two-dimensional representa-
tion that illustrates these definitions. The black dot

and of the cluster centroids (ii).

represents the vote vector for our example okay,
the vertices of the triangle correspond to the three
unanimous-vote vectors (A, B and C), and the cross
in the center of the triangle represents the vote vector
of a three-way tie between the labelers

(

.
We are thus able to calculate the Euclidean dis-

tance of a vote vector to each of the unanimous-vote
vectors. The shortest of these distances corresponds
to the label assigned by the plurality4 of subjects.
Also, the smaller that distance, the higher the inter-
subject agreement for that particular token. For our

who gets more votes than any other candidate is the winner.

example okay, the distances to A, B and C are 0.972,
1.070 and 0.495, respectively; its plurality label is C.

In our experiment, each okay has two associated
vote vectors, one for each context condition. To
illustrate the relationship between decisions in the
isolated and the contextualized conditions, we first
grouped each condition’s 54 vote vectors into three
clusters, according to their plurality label. Figure
2.ii shows the cluster centroids in a two-dimensional
representation of vote vectors. The filled dots corre-
spond to the cluster centroids of the isolated condi-
tion, and the empty dots, to the centroids of the con-
textualized condition. Table 4 shows the distances
in each condition from the cluster centroids (denoted
A

) to the respective unanimous-vote vec-

tors (A, B, C), and also the distance between each
pair of cluster centroids.

and between cluster centroids, in each condition.

In the isolated condition, the three cluster cen-
troids are approximately equidistant from each other
—that is, the three word functions appear to be
equally confusable. In the contextualized condi-
tion, while C

c
is further apart from the other two

centroids, the distance between A
c

and B
c

remains
practically the same. This suggests that, with some
context available, A and B tokens are still fairly con-
fusable, while both are more easily distinguished
from C tokens. We posit two possible explanations
for this: First, C is the only function for which
the speaker uttering the okay necessarily continues
speaking; thus the role of context in disambiguat-
ing seems quite clear. Second, both A and B have a
common element of ‘acknowledgement’ that might
affect inter-subject agreement.

804



4.3 Features of the okay tokens

In this section, we describe a set of acoustic,
prosodic, phonetic and contextual features which
may help to explain why subjects interpret okay dif-
ferently. Acoustic features were extracted automat-
ically using Praat. Phonetic and prosodic features
were hand-labeled by expert annotators. Contextual
features were considered only in the analysis of the
contextualized condition, since they were not avail-
able to subjects in the isolated condition.

We examined a number of phonetic features to de-
termine whether these correlated with subject clas-
sifications. We first looked at the production of the
three phonemes in the target okay (/oU/, /k/, /eI/),
noting the following possible variations:

• /oU/: [], [A], [5], [O], [OU], [m], [N], [@], [@U].
• /k/: [G], [k], [kx], [q], [x].
• /eI/: [e], [eI], [E], [e@].

We also calculated the duration of each phone and
of the velar closure. Whether the target okay was at
least partially whispered or not, and whether there
was glottalization in the target okay were also noted.

For each target okay, we also examined its du-
ration and its maximum, mean and minimum pitch
and intensity, as well as the speaker-normalized ver-
sions of these values.5 We considered its pitch slope,
intensity slope, and stylized pitch slope, calculated
over the whole target okay, its last 50, 80 and 100
milliseconds, its second half, its second syllable, and
the second half of its second syllable, as well.

We used the ToBI labeling scheme (Pitrelli et al.,
1994) to label the prosody of the target okays and
their surrounding context.

• Pitch accent, if any, of the target okay (e.g., H*,
H+!H*, L*).

• Break index after the target okay (0-4).
• Phrase accent and boundary tone, if any, fol-

lowing the target okay (e.g., L-L%, !H-H%).

For contextualized tokens, we included several fea-
tures related to the exchange between the speaker
uttering the target okay (Speaker B) and the other
speaker (Speaker A).

5Speaker-normalized features were normalized by comput-
ing z-scores (z = (X −mean)/st.dev) for the feature, where
mean and st.dev were calculated from all okays uttered by the
speaker in the session.

• Number of words uttered by Speaker A in the
context, before and after the target okay. Same
for Speaker B.

• Latency of Speaker A before Speaker B’s turn.
• Duration of silence of Speaker B before and af-

ter the target okay.
• Duration of speech by Speaker B immediately

before and after the target okay and up to a si-
lence.

4.4 Cues to interpretation

We conducted a series of Pearson’s tests to look for
correlations between the proportion of subjects that
chose each label and the numeric features described
in Section 4.3, together with two-sided t-tests to find
whether such correlations differed significantly from
zero. Tables 5 and 6 show the significant results
(two-sided t-tests, p < 0.05) for the isolated and
contextualized conditions, respectively.

Acknowledgement/agreement r

Backchannel r
stylized pitch slope over 2nd half 2nd syl. 0.752
pitch slope over 2nd half of 2nd syllable 0.409

pitch slope over the whole word –0.342
pitch slope over 2nd half of 2nd syllable –0.319

Table 5: Features correlated to the proportion of
votes for each label. Isolated condition.

Table 5 shows that in the isolated condition, sub-
jects tended to classify tokens of okay as Acknowl-
edgment/agreement (A) which had a longer realiza-
tion of the /k/ phoneme. They tended to classify
tokens as Backchannels (B) which had a lower in-
tensity, a longer duration, a longer realization of the
/eI/ phoneme, and a final rising pitch. They tended
to classify tokens as C (cue to topic beginning) that
ended with falling pitch.

Table 6: Features correlated to the proportion of
votes for each label. Contextualized condition.

In the contextualized condition, we find very dif-
ferent correlations. Table 6 shows that nearly all of
the strong correlations in this condition involve con-
textual features, such as the latency before Speaker
B’s turn, or the number of words by each speaker be-
fore and after the target okay. Notably, only one of
the features that show strong correlations in the iso-
lated condition shows the same strong correlation in
the contextualized condition: the pitch slope at the
end of the word. In both conditions subjects tended
to label tokens with a final rising pitch contour as
B, and tokens with a final falling pitch contour as C.
This supports (Hockey, 1993)’s findings on the role
of pitch contour in disambiguating okay.

We next conducted a series of two-sided Fisher’s
exact tests to find correlations between subjects’ la-
belings of okay and the nominal features described
in Section 4.3. We found significant associations be-
tween the realization of the /oU/ phoneme and the
okay function in the isolated condition (p < 0.005).
Table 7 shows that, in particular, [m] seems to be the
preferred realization for B okays, while [@] seems to
be the preferred one for A okays, and [OU] and [O]
for A and C okays.

? [A] [5] [OU] [O] [N] [@U] [@] [] [m]
A 0 0 5 6 4 0 0 8 0 0
B 2 0 4 1 0 1 0 1 1 5
C 1 1 2 3 4 0 1 3 0 0

Table 7: Realization of the /oU/ phoneme, grouped
by subject plurality label. Isolated condition only.

Notably, we did not find such significant asso-
ciations in the contextualized condition. We did
find significant correlations in both conditions, how-
ever, between okay classifications and the type of
phrase accent and boundary tone following the target
(Fisher’s Exact Test, p < 0.05 for the isolated con-
dition, p < 0.005 for the contextualized condition).
Table 8 shows that L-L% tends to be associated with
A and C classes, H-H% with B classes, and L-H%
with A and B classes. In this case, such correlations
are present in the isolated condition, and sustained
or enhanced in the contextualized condition.

Table 8: Phrase accent and boundary tone, grouped

Summing up, when subjects listened to the okay
tokens in isolation, with only their acoustic, prosodic
and phonetic properties available, a few features
seem to strongly correlate with the perception of
word function; for example, maximum intensity,
word duration, and realizing the /oU/ phoneme as
[m] tend to be associated with backchannel, while
the duration of the realization of the /k/ phoneme,
and realizing the /oU/ phoneme as [@] tend to be as-
sociated with acknowledgment/agreement.

In the second part of the study, when subjects
listened to contextualized versions of the same to-
kens of okay, most of the strong correlations of word
function with acoustic, prosodic and phonetic fea-
tures were replaced by correlations with contextual
features, like latency and turn duration. In other
words, these results suggest that contextual features

might override the effect of most acoustic, prosodic
and phonetic features of okay. There is nonethe-
less one notable exception: word final intonation —
captured by the pitch slope and the ToBI labels for
phrase accent and boundary tone — seems to play a
central role in the interpretation of both isolated and
contextualized okays.

5 Conclusion and future work

In this study, we have presented evidence of differ-
ences in the interpretation of the function of isolated
and contextualized okays. We have shown that word
final intonation strongly correlates with the subjects’
classification of okays in both conditions. Addition-
ally, the higher degree of inter-subject agreement in
the contextualized condition, along with the strong
correlations found for contextualized features, sug-
gests that context, when available, plays a central
role in the disambiguation of okay. (Note, how-
ever, that further research is needed in order to assess
whether these features are indeed, in fact, perceptu-
ally important, both individually and combined.)

We have also presented results suggesting that ac-
knowledgment/agreement acts as a default function
for both isolated an contextualized okays. Further-
more, while that function remains confusable with
backchannel in both conditions, the availability of
some context helps in distinguishing those two func-
tions from cue to topic beginning.

These results are relevant to spoken dialogue sys-
tems in suggesting how systems can convey the cue
word okay with the intended meaning and can inter-
pret users’ productions of okay correctly. How these
results extend to other cue words and to other word
functions remains an open question.

As future work, we will extend this study to in-
clude the over 5800 occurrences of alright, gotcha,
huh, mmhm, okay, right, uhhuh, yeah, yep, yes, yup
in the entire Games Corpus, and all 10 discourse
functions mentioned in Section 2, as annotated by
our three original labelers. Since we have observed
considerable differences in conversation style in the
two parts of the corpus (the Objects Games elicited
more ‘dynamic’ conversations, with more overlaps
and interruptions than the Cards Games), we will
compare cue phrase usage in these two settings. Fi-
nally, we are also interested in examining speaker

entrainment in cue phrase usage, or how subjects
adapt their choice and production of cue phrases to
their conversation partner’s.
