Abstract

This paper presents a language-independent
probabilistic answer ranking framework for
question answering. The framework esti-
mates the probability of an individual an-
swer candidate given the degree of answer
relevance and the amount of supporting evi-
dence provided in the set of answer candi-
dates for the question. Our approach was
evaluated by comparing the candidate an-
swer sets generated by Chinese and Japanese
answer extractors with the re-ranked answer
sets produced by the answer ranking frame-
work. Empirical results from testing on NT-
CIR factoid questions show a 40% perfor-
mance improvement in Chinese answer se-
lection and a 45% improvement in Japanese
answer selection.

1 Introduction

Question answering (QA) systems aim at find-
ing precise answers to natural language questions
from large document collections. Typical QA sys-
tems (Prager et al., 2000; Clarke et al., 2001;
Harabagiu et al., 2000) adopt a pipeline architec-
ture that incorporates four major steps: (1) question
analysis, (2) document retrieval, (3) answer extrac-
tion and (4) answer selection. Question analysis is
a process which analyzes a question and produces a
list of keywords. Document retrieval is a step that
searches for relevant documents or passages. An-
swer extraction extracts a list of answer candidates
from the retrieved documents. Answer selection is a

process which pinpoints correct answer(s) from the
extracted candidate answers.

Since the first three steps in the QA pipeline may
produce erroneous outputs, the final answer selec-
tion step often entails identifying correct answer(s)
amongst many incorrect ones. For example, given
the question “Which Chinese city has the largest
number of foreign financial companies?”, the an-
swer extraction component produces a ranked list of
five answer candidates: Beijing (AP880603-0268)1,
Hong Kong (WSJ920110-0013), Shanghai (FBIS3-
58), Taiwan (FT942-2016) and Shanghai (FBIS3-
45320). Due to imprecision in answer extraction,
an incorrect answer (“Beijing”) can be ranked in
the first position, and the correct answer (“Shang-
hai”) was extracted from two different documents
and ranked in the third and the fifth positions. In or-
der to rank “Shanghai” in the top position, we have
to address two interesting challenges:

• Answer Similarity. How do we exploit simi-
larity among answer candidates? For example,
when the candidates list contains redundant an-
swers (e.g., “Shanghai” as above) or several an-
swers which represent a single instance (e.g.
“U.S.A.” and “the United States”), how much
should we boost the rank of the redundant an-
swers?

• Answer Relevance. How do we identify
relevant answer(s) amongst irrelevant ones?
This task may involve searching for evi-
dence of a relationship between the answer

TREC document where they were found.

and the answer type or a question key-
word. For example, we might wish to query
a knowledge base to determine if “Shang-
hai” is a city (IS-A(Shanghai, city)),
or to determine if Shanghai is in China
(IS-IN(Shanghai, China)).

The first challenge is to exploit redundancy in the
set of answer candidates. As answer candidates are
extracted from different documents, they may con-
tain identical, similar or complementary text snip-
pets. For example, “U.S.” can appear as “United
States” or “USA” in different documents. It is im-
portant to detect redundant information and boost
answer confidence, especially for list questions that
require a set of unique answers. One approach is
to perform answer clustering (Nyberg et al., 2002;
Jijkoun et al., 2006). However, the use of cluster-
ing raises additional questions: how to calculate the
score of the clustered answers, and how to select the
cluster label.

To address the second question, several answer
selection approaches have used external knowledge
resources such as WordNet, CYC and gazetteers for
answer validation or answer reranking. Answer can-
didates are either removed or discounted if they are
not of the expected answer type (Xu et al., 2002;
Moldovan et al., 2003; Chu-Carroll et al., 2003;
Echihabi et al., 2004). The Web also has been used
for answer reranking by exploiting search engine re-
sults produced by queries containing the answer can-
didate and question keywords (Magnini et al., 2002).
This approach has been used in various languages
for answer validation. Wikipedia’s structured in-
formation was used for Spanish answer type check-
ing (Buscaldi and Rosso, 2006).

Although many QA systems have incorporated in-
dividual features and/or resources for answer selec-
tion in a single language, there has been little re-
search on a generalized probabilistic framework that
supports answer ranking in multiple languages using
any answer relevance and answer similarity features
that are appropriate for the language in question.

In this paper, we describe a probabilistic answer
ranking framework for multiple languages. The
framework uses logistic regression to estimate the
probability that an answer candidate is correct given
multiple answer relevance features and answer sim-

ilarity features. An existing framework which was
originally developed for English (Ko et al., 2007)
was extended for Chinese and Japanese answer
ranking by incorporating language-specific features.
Empirical results on NTCIR Chinese and Japanese
factoid questions show that the framework signifi-
cantly improved answer selection performance; Chi-
nese performance improved by 40% over the base-
line, and Japanese performance improved by 45%
over the baseline.

The remainder of this paper is organized as fol-
lows: Section 2 contains an overview of the answer
ranking task. Section 3 summarizes the answer rank-
ing framework. In Section 4, we explain how we
extended the framework by incorporating language-
specific features. Section 5 describes the experimen-
tal methodology and results. Finally, Section 6 con-
cludes with suggestions for future research.

2 Answer Ranking Task

The relevance of an answer to a question can be es-
timated by the probability P(correct(Ai) |Ai, Q),
where Q is a question and Ai is an answer can-
didate. To exploit answer similarity, we estimate
the probability P (correct(Ai) |Ai, Aj), where Aj
is similar to Ai. Since both probabilities influence
overall answer ranking performance, it is important
to combine them in a unified framework and es-
timate the probability of an answer candidate as:
P (correct(Ai)|Q,A1, ..., An).

The estimated probability is used to rank answer
candidates and select final answers from the list. For
factoid questions, the top answer is selected as a fi-
nal answer to the question. In addition, we can use
the estimated probability to classify incorrect an-
swers: if the probability of an answer candidate is
lower than 0.5, it is considered to be a wrong answer
and is filtered out of the answer list. This is useful
in deciding whether or not a valid answer to a ques-
tion exists in a given corpus (Voorhees, 2002). The
estimated probability can also be used in conjunc-
tion with a cutoff threshold when selecting multiple
answers to list questions.

3 Answer Ranking Framework

work, originally developed for English answers (Ko

Figure 1: Estimating correctness of an answer candidate given a question and a set of answer candidates

et al., 2007). The model uses logistic regression
to estimate the probability of an answer candidate
(Figure 1). Each relk(Ai) is a feature function used
to produce an answer relevance score for an an-
swer candidate Ai. Each sim

′
k(Ai, Aj) is a similar-

ity function used to calculate an answer similarity
between Ai and Aj . K1 and K2 are the number of
answer relevance and answer similarity features, re-
spectively. N is the number of answer candidates.

To incorporate multiple similarity features, each
simk(Ai) is obtained from an individual similarity
metric, sim′k(Ai, Aj). For example, if Levenshtein
distance is used as one similarity metric, simk(Ai)
is calculated by summing N-1 Levenshtein distances
between one answer candidate and all other candi-
dates.

The parameters α, β, λ were estimated from train-
ing data by maximizing the log likelihood. We used
the Quasi-Newton algorithm (Minka, 2003) for pa-
rameter estimation.

Multiple features were used to generate answer
relevance scores and answer similarity scores; these
are discussed below.

3.1 Answer Relevance Features

Answer relevance features can be classified into
knowledge-based features or data-driven features.
1) Knowledge-based features
Gazetteers: Gazetteers provide geographic infor-
mation, which allows us to identify strings as in-
stances of countries, their cities, continents, capitals,
etc. For answer ranking, three gazetteer resources
were used: the Tipster Gazetteer, the CIA World

Factbook and information about the US states pro-
vided by 50states.com. These resources were used
to assign an answer relevance score between -1 and
1 to each candidate. For example, given the question
“Which city in China has the largest number of for-
eign financial companies?”, the candidate “Shang-
hai” receives a score of 0.5 because it is a city in the
gazetteers. But “Taiwan” receives a score of -1.0 be-
cause it is not a city in the gazetteers. A score of 0
means the gazetteers did not contribute to the answer
selection process for that candidate.

Ontology: Ontologies such as WordNet contain
information about relationships between words and
general meaning types (synsets, semantic categories,
etc.). WordNet was used to identify answer rele-
vance in a manner analogous to the use of gazetteers.
For example, given the question “Who wrote the
book ’Song of Solomon’?”, the candidate “Mark
Twain” receives a score of 0.5 because its hyper-
nyms include “writer”.
2) Data-driven features
Wikipedia: Wikipedia was used to generate an an-
swer relevance score. If there is a Wikipedia docu-
ment whose title matches an answer candidate, the
document is analyzed to obtain the term frequency
(tf) and the inverse term frequency (idf) of the can-
didate, from which a tf.idf score is calculated. When
there is no matched document, each question key-
word is also processed as a back-off strategy, and the
answer relevance score is calculated by summing the
tf.idf scores obtained from individual keywords.

Google: Following Magnini et al. (2002), a query
consisting of an answer candidate and question key-

786



words was sent to the Google search engine. Then
the top 10 text snippets returned by Google were
analyzed to generate an answer relevance score by
computing the minimum number of words between
a keyword and the answer candidate.

3.2 Answer Similarity Features

Answer similarity is calculated using multiple string
distance metrics and a list of synonyms.

String Distance Metrics: String distance metrics
such as Levenshtein, Jaro-Winkler, and Cosine sim-
ilarity were used to calculate the similarity between
two English answer candidates.

Synonyms: Synonyms can be used as another
metric to calculate answer similarity. If one answer
is synonym of another answer, the score is 1. Other-
wise the score is 0. To get a list of synonyms, three
knowledge bases were used: WordNet, Wikipedia
and the CIA World Factbook. In addition, manually
generated rules were used to obtain synonyms for
different types of answer candidates. For example,
“April 12 1914” and “12th Apr. 1914” are converted
into “1914-04-12” and treated as synonyms.

4 Extensions for Multiple Languages

We extended the framework for Chinese and
Japanese QA. This section details how we incor-
porated language-specific resources into the frame-
work. As logistic regression is based on a proba-
bilistic framework, the model does not need to be
changed to support other languages. We only re-
trained the model for individual languages. To sup-
port Chinese and Japanese QA, we incorporated new
features for individual languages.

4.1 Answer Relevance Features

We replaced the English gazetteers and WordNet
with language-specific resources for Japanese and
Chinese. As Wikipedia and the Web support mul-
tiple languages, the same algorithm was used in
searching language-specific corpora for the two lan-
guages.
1) Knowledge-based features
The knowledge-based features involve searching for
facts in a knowledge base such as gazetteers and
WordNet. We utilized comparable resources for
Chinese and Japanese. Using language-specific re-

Chinese 69,936 197,447

Table 1: Articles in Wikipedia for different lan-
guages

sources, the same algorithms were applied to gener-
ate an answer relevance score between -1 and 1.

Gazetteers: There are few available gazetteers
for Chinese and Japanese. Therefore, we extracted
location data from language-specific resources. For
Japanese, we extracted Japanese location informa-
tion from Yahoo2, which contains many location
names in Japan and the relationships among them.
For Chinese, we extracted location names from the
Web. In addition, we translated country names pro-
vided by the CIA World Factbook and the Tipster
gazetteers into Chinese and Japanese names. As
there is more than one translation, top 3 translations
were used.

Ontology: For Chinese, we used HowNet (Dong,
2000) which is a Chinese version of WordNet.
It contains 65,000 Chinese concepts and 75,000
corresponding English equivalents. For Japanese,
we used semantic classes provided by Gengo
GoiTaikei3. Gengo GoiTaikei is a Japanese lexicon
containing 300,000 Japanese words with their asso-
ciated 3,000 semantic classes. The semantic infor-
mation provided by HowNet and Gengo GoiTaikei
was used to assign an answer relevance score be-
tween -1 and 1.
2) Data-driven features
Wikipedia: As Wikipedia supports more than 200
language editions, the approach used in English can
be used for different languages without any modifi-
cation. Table 1 shows the number of text articles in
three different languages. Wikipedia’s current cov-
erage in Japanese and Chinese does not match its
coverage in English, but coverage in these languages
continues to improve.

To supplement the small corpus of Chi-
nese documents available, we used Baidu

2http://map.yahoo.co.jp/
3http://www.kecl.ntt.co.jp/mtg/resources/GoiTaikei

787



(http://baike.baidu.com), which is similar to
Wikipedia but contains more articles written in
Chinese. We first search for Chinese Wikipedia.
When there is no matching document in Wikipedia,
each answer candidate is sent to Baidu and the
retrieved document is analyzed in the same way to
analyze Wikipedia documents.

The idf score was calculated using word statis-
tics from Japanese Yomiuri newspaper corpus and
the NTCIR Chinese corpus.

Google: The same algorithm was applied to ana-
lyze Japanese and Chinese snippets returned from
Google. But we restricted the language to Chi-
nese or Japanese so that Google returned only Chi-
nese or Japanese documents. To calculate the dis-
tance between an answer candidate and question
keywords, segmentation was done with linguistic
tools. For Japanese, Chasen4 was used. For Chinese
segmentation, a maximum-entropy based parser was
used (Wang et al., 2006).

3) Manual Filtering

Other than the features mentioned above, we man-
ually created many rules for numeric and temporal
questions to filter out invalid answers. For example,
when the question is looking for a year as an answer,
an answer candidate which contains only the month
receives a score of -1. Otherwise, the score is 0.

4.2 Answer Similarity Features

The same features used for English were applied
to calculate the similarity of Chinese/Japanese an-
swer candidates. To identify synonyms, Wikipedia
were used for both Chinese and Japanese. EIJIRO
dictionary was used to obtain Japanese synonyms.
EIJIRO is a English-Japanese dictionary contain-
ing 1,576,138 words and provides synonyms for
Japanese words.

As there are several different ways to represent
temporal and numeric expressions (Nyberg et al.,
2002; Greenwood, 2006), language-specific conver-
sion rules were applied to convert them into a canon-
ical format; for example, a rule to convert Japanese
Kanji characters to Arabic numbers is shown in Fig-
ure 2.

5 Experiments

This section describes the experiments to evaluate
the extended answer ranking framework for Chinese
and Japanese QA.

5.1 Experimental Setup

We used Chinese and Japanese questions provided
by the NTCIR (NII Test Collection for IR Sys-
tems), which focuses on evaluating cross-lingual
and monolingual QA tasks for Chinese, Japanese
and English. For Chinese, a total of 550 fac-
toid questions from the NTCIR5-6 QA evaluations
served as the dataset. Among them, 200 questions
were used to train the Chinese answer extractor and
350 questions were used to evaluate our answer
ranking framework. For Japanese, 700 questions
from the NTCIR5-6 QA evaluations served as the
dataset. Among them, 300 questions were used to
train the Japanese answer extractor and 400 ques-
tions were used to evaluate our framework.

Both the Chinese and Japanese answer extractors
use maximum-entropy to extract answer candidates
based on multiple features such as named entity, de-
pendency structures and some language-dependent
features.

Performance of the answer ranking framework
was measured by average answer accuracy: the
number of correct top answers divided by the num-
ber of questions where at least one correct answer
exists in the candidate list provided by an extrac-
tor. Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR5) was also used
to calculate the average reciprocal rank of the first
correct answer in the top 5 answers.

The baseline for average answer accuracy was
calculated using the answer candidate likelihood
scores provided by each individual extractor; the

answer with the best extractor score was chosen,
and no validation or similarity processing was per-
formed.

3-fold cross-validation was performed, and we
used a version of Wikipedia downloaded in Aug
2006.

5.2 Results and Analysis

We first analyzed the average accuracy of top 1, top3
and top 5 answers. Figure 3 compares the average
accuracy using the baseline and the answer selec-
tion framework. As can be seen, the answer rank-
ing framework significantly improved performance
on both Chinese and Japanese answer selection. As
for the average top answer accuracy, there were 40%
improvement over the baseline (Chinese) and 45%
improvement over the baseline (Japanese).

We also analyzed the degree to which the average
accuracy was affected by answer similarity and rel-
evance features. Table 2 compares the average top
answer accuracy using the baseline, the answer rel-
evance features, the answer similarity features and
all feature combinations. Both the similarity and the
relevance features significantly improved answer se-
lection performance compared to the baseline, and
combining both sets of features together produced
the best performance.

We further analyzed the utility of individual rele-
vance features (Figure 4). For both languages, filter-
ing was useful in ruling out wrong answers. The im-

pact of the ontology was more positive for Japanese;
we assume that this is because the Chinese ontol-
ogy (HowNet) contains much less information over-
all than the Japanese ontology (Gengo GoiTaikei).
The comparative impact of Wikipedia was similar.
For Chinese, there were many fewer Wikipedia doc-
uments available. Even though we used Baidu as a
supplemental resource for Chinese, this did not im-
prove answer selection performance. On the other
hand, the use of Wikipedia was very helpful for
Japanese, improving performance by 26% over the
baseline. This shows that the quality of answer
relevance estimation is significantly affected by re-
source coverage.

When comparing the data-driven features with the
knowledge-based features, the data-driven features
(such as Wikipedia and Google) tended to increase
performance more than the knowledge-based fea-
tures (such as gazetteers and WordNet).

ity features on Chinese and Japanese answer selec-

tion. As some string similarity features (e.g., Lev-
enshtein distance) produce a number between 0 and
1 (where 1 means two strings are identical and 0
means they are different), similarity scores less than
a threshold can be ignored. We used two thresh-
olds: 0.3 and 0.5. In our experiments, using 0.3
as a threshold produced better results in Chinese.
In Japanese, 0,5 was a better threshold for individ-
ual features. Among three different string similar-
ity features (Levenshtein, Jaro-Winkler and Cosine
similarity), cosine similarity tended to perform bet-
ter than the others.

When comparing synonym features with string
similarity features, synonyms performed better than
string similarity in Japanese, but not in Chinese. We
had many more synonyms available for Japanese

and they helped the system to better exploit answer
redundancy.

We also analyzed answer selection performance
when combining all four similarity features (“All”
in Table 3). Combining all similarity features im-
proved the performance in Japanese, but hurt the
performance in Chinese, because adding a small set
of synonyms to the string metrics worsened the per-
formance of logistic regression.

5.3 Utility of data-driven features

In our experiments we used data-driven fea-
tures as well as knowledge-based features. As
knowledge-based features need manual effort to ac-
cess language-specific resources for individual lan-
guages, we conducted an additional experiment only
with data-driven features in order to see how much
performance gain is available without the manual
work. As Google, Wikipedia and string similarity
metrics can be used without any additional manual
effort when extended to other languages, we used
these three features and compared the performance.

Table 4 shows the performance when using data-
driven features v.s. all features. It can be seen that
data-driven features alone achieved significant im-
provement over the baseline. This indicates that the
framework can easily be extended to any language
where appropriate data resources are available, even
if knowledge-based features and resources for the
language are still under development.

6 Conclusion

In this paper, we presented a generalized answer se-
lection framework which was applied to Chinese and
Japanese question answering. An empirical evalu-
ation using NTCIR test questions showed that the
framework significantly improves baseline answer
selection performance. For Chinese, the perfor-
mance improved by 40% over the baseline. For
Japanese, the performance improved by 45% over

790



the baseline. This shows that our probabilistic
framework can be easily extended for multiple lan-
guages by reusing data-driven features (with new
corpora) and adding language-specific resources
(ontologies, gazetteers) for knowledge-based fea-
tures.

In our previous work, we evaluated the perfor-
mance of the framework for English QA using ques-
tions from past TREC evaluations (Ko et al., 2007).
The experimental results showed that the combina-
tion of all answer ranking features improved per-
formance by an average of 102% over the baseline.
The relevance features improved performance by an
average of 99% over the baseline, and the similar-
ity features improved performance by an average of
46% over the baseline. Our hypothesis is that answer
relevance features had a greater impact for English
QA because the quality and coverage of the data re-
sources available for English answer validation is
much higher than the quality and coverage of ex-
isting resources for Japanese and Chinese. In future
work, we will continue to evaluate the robustness of
the framework. It is also clear from our comparison
with English QA that more work can and should be
done in acquiring data resources for answer valida-
tion in Chinese and Japanese.
