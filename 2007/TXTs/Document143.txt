Abstract

We demonstrate one aspect of an affect-
extraction system for use in intelligent con-
versational agents. This aspect performs a
degree of affective interpretation of some
types of metaphorical utterance.

1 Introduction

Our demonstration is of one aspect of a system
for extracting affective information from individ-
ual utterances, for use in text-based intelligent con-
versational agents (ICAs). Affect includes emo-
tions/moods (such as embarrassment, hostility) and
evaluations (of goodness, importance, etc.). Our
own particular ICA [Zhang et al. 2006] is for use
in an e-drama system, where human users behave as
actors engaged in unscripted role-play. Actors type
in utterances for the on-screen characters they con-
trol to utter (via speech bubbles). Our ICA is an-
other actor, controlling a bit-part character. Through
extracting affect from other characters’ utterances it
makes responses that can help keep the conversation
flowing. The same algorithms are also used for in-
fluencing the characters’ gesturing (when a 3D ani-
mation mode is used).

The system aspect demonstrated handles one im-
portant way in which affect is expressed in most dis-
course genres: namely metaphor. Only a relatively
small amount of work has been done on computa-
tional processing of metaphorical meaning, for any
purpose, let alone in ICA research. Major work
apart from ours on metaphorical-meaning compu-
tation includes (Fass, 1997; Hobbs, 1990; Mar-
tin, 1990; Mason, 2004; Narayanan, 1999; Veale,
1998). The e-drama genre exhibits a variety of types

of metaphor, with a significant degree of linguistic
open-endedness. Also, note that our overarching re-
search aim is to study metaphor as such, not just how
it arises in e-drama. This increases our need for sys-
tematic, open-ended methods.

2 Metaphor and Affect

Conveying affect is one important role for metaphor,
and metaphor is one important way of conveying
affect. Emotional states and behavior often them-
selves described metaphorically (Kövecses, 2000;
Fussell & Moss, 1998), as in ‘He was boiling
inside’ [feelings of anger]. But another impor-
tant phenomenon is describing something X using
metaphorical source terms that are subject to that
affect, as in ‘My son’s room [= X] is a bomb site’
or ‘smelly attitude’ (an e-drama transcript exam-
ple). Such carry-over of affect in metaphor is well-
recognized, e.g. in the political domain (Musolff,
2004). Our transcript analyses indicate that this type
of affect-laden metaphor is a significant issue in e-
drama: at a conservative estimate, in recent user
studies in secondary schools at least one in every
16 speech-turns has contained such metaphor (each
turn is

�
100 characters, and rarely more than one

sentence; 33K words across all transcripts).
There are other specific, theoretically interesting

metaphorical phenomena arising in e-drama that are
important also for discourse in general, and plausi-
bly could be handled reasonably successfully in an
ICA using current techniques. Some are:
1) Casting someone as an animal. This often con-
veys affect, from insultingly negative to affection-
ately positive. Terms for young animals (‘piglet’,
‘wolf cub’, etc.) are often used affectionately, even

37



when the adult form is negative. Animal words can
have a conventional metaphorical sense, often with
specific affect, but in non-conventional cases a sys-
tem may still be able to discern a particular affective
connotation; and even if it cannot, it can still plausi-
bly infer that some affect is expressed, of unknown
polarity (positivity/negativity).
2) Rather similarly, casting someone as a monster
or as a mythical or supernatural being, using words
such as ‘monster’, ‘dragon,’ ‘angel,’ ‘devil.’
3) Casting someone as a special type of human, us-
ing words such as ‘baby’ (to an adult), ‘freak,’ ‘girl’
(to a boy), ‘lunatic.’
4) Metaphorical use of size adjectives (cf. Sharoff,
2006). Particularly, using ‘a little X’ to convey af-
fective qualities of X such as unimportance and con-
temptibility, but sometimes affection towards X, and
‘big X’ to convey importance of X (‘big event’) or
intensity of X-ness (‘big bully’)—and X can itself
be metaphorical (‘baby’, ‘ape’).
Currently, our system partially addresses (1), (2) and
(4).

3 Metaphor Recognition & Analysis

3.1 The Recognition Component

The basis here is a subset of a list of
metaphoricity signals we have compiled
[http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/˜jab/ATT-
Meta/metaphoricity-signals.html], by modify-
ing and expanding a list from Goatly (1997). The
signals include specific syntactic structures, phrase-
ological items and morphological elements. We
currently focus on two special syntactic structures,
X is/are Y and You/you Y, and some lexical strings
such as ‘[looks] like’, ‘a bit of a’ and ‘such a’. The
signals are merely uncertain, heuristic indicators.
For instance, in the transcripts mentioned in section
2, we judged X is/are Y as actually indicating the
presence of metaphor in 38% of cases (18 out of
47). Other success rates are: you Y – 61% (22 out of
36); like (including looks like)– 81% (35 out of 43).

In order to detect signals we use the Grammatical
Relations (GR) output from the RASP robust parser
[Briscoe et al., 2006] This output shows typed word-
pair dependencies between the words in the utter-
ance. E.g., the GR output for ‘You are a pig’ is:

|ncsubj| |be+_vbr| |you_ppy| |_|
|xcomp| _ |be+_vbr| |pig_nn1|
|det| |pig_nn1| |a_at1|

For an utterance of the type X is/are Y the GRs will
always give a subject relation (ncsubj) between X
and the verb ‘to be’, as well as a complement re-
lation (xcomp) between the verb and the noun Y.
The structure is detected by finding these relations.
As for you Y, Rasp also typically delivers an easily
analysable structure, but unfortunately the POS tag-
ger in Rasp seems to favour tagging Y as a verb—
e.g., ‘cow’ in ‘You cow’. In such a case, our system
looks the word up in a list of tagged words that forms
part of the RASP tagger. If the verb can be tagged
as a noun, the tag is changed, and the metaphoricity
signal is deemed detected. Once a signal is detected,
the word(s) in relevant positions (e.g. the Y posi-
tion) position are pulled out to be analysed. This
approach has the advantage that whether or not the
noun in, say, the Y position has adjectival modifiers
the GR between the verb and Y is the same, so the
detection tolerates a large amount of variation. Any
such modifiers are found in modifying relations and
are available for use in the Analysis Component.

3.2 The Analysis Component
We confine attention here to X–is/are–Y and You–Y
cases. The analysis element of the processing takes
the X noun (if any) and Y noun and uses Word-
Net 2.0 to analyse them. First, we try to determine
whether X refers to a person (the only case the sys-
tem currently deals with), partly by using a specified
list of proper names of characters in the drama and
partly by WordNet processing. If so, then the Y and
remaining elements are analysed using WordNet’s
taxonomy. This allows us to see if the Y noun in one
of its senses is a hyponym of animals or supernatural
beings. If this is established, the system sees if an-
other of the senses of the word is a hyponym of the
person synset, as many metaphors are already given
as senses in WordNet. If different senses of the given
word are hyponyms of both animal and person, other
categories in the tree between the noun and the per-
son synset may provide information about the eval-
uative content of the metaphor. For example the
word ‘cow’ in its metaphorical usage has the ‘un-
pleasant person’ synset as a lower hypernym, which
heuristically suggests that, when the word is used in
a metaphor, it will be negative about the target.

There is a further complication. Baby animal
names can often be used to give a statement a more
affectionate quality. Some baby animal names such
as ‘piglet’ do not have a metaphorical sense in Word-

38



Net. In these cases, we check the word’s gloss to see
if it is a young animal and what kind of animal it
is. We then process the adult animal name to seek a
metaphorical meaning but add the quality of affec-
tion to the result. A higher degree of confidence is
attached to the quality of affection than is attached
to the positive/negative result, if any, obtained from
the adult name. Other baby animal names such as
‘lamb’ do have a metaphorical sense in WordNet in-
dependently of the adult animal, and are therefore
evaluated as in the previous paragraph. They are
also flagged as potentially expressing affection but
with a lesser degree of confidence than that gained
from the metaphorical processing of the word. How-
ever, the youth of an animal is not always encoded
in a single word: e.g., ‘cub’ may be accompanied
by specification of an animal type, as in ‘wolf cub’.
An extension to our processing would be required to
handle this and also cases like ‘young wolf’ or ‘baby
wolf’.

If any adjectival modifiers of the Y noun were rec-
ognized the analyser then goes on to evaluate their
contribution to the metaphor’s affect. If the analyser
finds that ‘big’ is one of the modifying adjectives
of the noun it has analysed the metaphor is marked
as being more emphatic. If ‘little’ is found the fol-
lowing is done. If the metaphor has been tagged as
negative and no degree of affection has been added
(from a baby animal name, currently) then ‘little’ is
taken to be expressing contempt. If the metaphor
has been tagged as positive OR a degree of affection
has been added then ‘little’ is taken to be expressing
affection.

4 Examples of Course of Processing

‘You piglet’:
(1) Detector recognises the you Y signal with Y =
‘piglet’.
(2) Analyser finds that ‘piglet’ is a hyponym of ‘an-
imal’.
(3) ‘Piglet’ does not have ‘person’ as a WordNet hy-
pernym so analyser retrieves the WordNet gloss.
(4) It finds ‘young’ in the gloss (‘a young pig’) and
retrieves all of the following words (just ‘pig’ – the
analysis process is would otherwise be repeated for
each of the words captured from the gloss), and finds
that ‘pig’ by itself has negative metaphorical affect.
(5) The input is labelled as an animal metaphor
which is negative but affectionate, with the affection

having higher confidence than the negativity.

‘Lisa is an angel’:
(1) Detector recognises the X is Y signal with Y =
‘angel’, after checking that Lisa is a person.
(2) Analyser finds that ‘angel’ is a hyponym of ‘su-
pernatural being’.
(3) It finds that in another sense ‘angel’ is a hyponym
of ‘person’.
(4) It finds that the tree including the ‘person’ synset
also passes through ‘good person,’ expressing posi-
tive affect.
(5) Conclusion: positive supernatural-
being metaphor.

Results from Some Other Examples:
“You cow”, “they’re such sheep”: negative

metaphor.
“You little rat”: contemptuous metaphor.
“You little piggy”: affectionate metaphor with a neg-

ative base.
“You’re a lamb”: affectionate metaphor.
“You are a monster”: negative metaphor.
“She is such a big fat cow”: negative metaphor, in-

tensified by ‘big’ (currently ‘fat’ is not dealt with).

5 Concluding Remarks

The demonstrated processing capabilities make par-
ticular but nevertheless valuable contributions to
metaphor processing and affect-detection for ICAs,
in e-drama at least. Further work is ongoing on the
four specific metaphorical phenomena in section 3
as well as on other phenomena, such as the vari-
ation of conventional metaphorical phraseology by
synonym substitution and addition of modifiers, and
metaphorical descriptions of emotions themselves.

As many extensions are ongoing or envisaged,
it is premature to engage in large-scale evaluation.
Also, there are basic problems facing evaluation.
The language in the e-drama genre is full of mis-
spellings, “texting” abbreviations, acronyms, gram-
matical errors, etc., so that fully automated evalua-
tion of the metaphorical processing by itself is dif-
ficult; and application of the system to manually
cleaned-up utterances is still dependent on Rasp ex-
tracting structure appropriately. Also, our own ul-
timate concerns are theoretical, to do with the na-
ture of metaphor understanding. We are interested
in covering the qualitative range of possibilities and
complications, with no strong constraint from their

39



frequency in real discourse. Thus, statistical evalua-
tion on corpora is not particularly relevant except for
practical purposes.

However, some proto-evaluative comments that
can be made about animal metaphors are as fol-
lows. The transcripts mentioned in section 2 (33K
words total) contain metaphors with the following
animal words: rhino, bitch, dog, ape, cow, mole,
from 14 metaphorical utterances in all. Seven of
the utterances are recognized by our system, and
these involve rhino, dog, ape, mole. No WordNet-
based metaphorical connotation is found for the
rhino case. Negative affect is concluded for bitch,
dog and cow cases, and affect of undetermined po-
larity is concluded for ape and mole.

The system is currently designed only to do rela-
tively simple, specialized metaphorical processing.
The system currently only deals with a small mi-
nority of our own list of metaphoricity signals (see
section 3.1), and these signals are only present in a
minority of cases of metaphor overall. It does not
do either complex reasoning or analogical structure-
matching as in our own ATT-Meta metaphor sys-
tem (Barnden, 2006) or the cited approaches of Fass,
Hobbs, Martin, Narayanan and Veale. However, we
plan to eventually add simplified versions of ATT-
Meta-style reasoning, and in particular to add the
ATT-Meta view-neutral mapping adjunct feature to
implement the default carry-over of affect (see sec-
tion 2) and certain other information, as well as han-
dling more signals.

Other work on metaphor has exploited WordNet
(see, e.g., Veale, 2003, and panel on Figurative Lan-
guage in WordNets and other Lexical Resources
at GWC’04 (http://www.fi.muni.cz/gwc2004/.
Such work uses WordNet in distinctly different ways
from us and largely for different purposes. Our sys-
tem is also distinctive in, for instance, interpreting
the contribution of size adjectives.
