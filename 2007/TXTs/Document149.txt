Abstract 

This paper presents noisy-channel based 
Korean preprocessor system, which cor-
rects word spacing and typographical errors. 
The proposed algorithm corrects both er-
rors simultaneously. Using Eojeol transi-
tion pattern dictionary and statistical data 
such as Eumjeol n-gram and Jaso transition 
probabilities, the algorithm minimizes the 
usage of huge word dictionaries. 

1 Introduction 
With increasing usages of messenger and SMS, we 
need an efficient text normalizer that processes 
colloquial style sentences. As in the case of general 
literary sentences, correcting word spacing error 
and spelling error is the very essential problem 
with colloquial style sentences. 

In order to correct word spacing errors, many 
algorithms were used, which can be divided into 
statistical algorithms and rule-based algorithms. 
Statistical algorithms generally use character n-
gram (Eojeol 1  or Eumjeol 2  n-gram in Korean) 
(Kang and Woo, 2001; Kwon, 2002) or noisy-
channel model (Gao et. al., 2003). Rule-based al-
gorithms are mostly heuristic algorithms that re-
flect linguistic knowledge (Yang et al., 2005) to 
solve word spacing problem. Word spacing prob-
lem is treated especially in Japanese or Chinese, 
                                                 
1 Eojeol is a Korean spacing unit which consists of one or 
more Eumjeols (morphemes). 
2 Eumjeol is a Korean syllable. 

which does not use word boundary, or Korean, 
which is normally segmented into Eojeols, not into 
words or morphemes. 

The previous algorithms for spelling error cor-
rection basically use a word dictionary. Each word 
in a sentence is compared to word dictionary en-
tries, and if the word is not in the dictionary, then 
the system assumes that the word has spelling er-
rors. Then corrected candidate words are suggested 
by the system from the word dictionary, according 
to some metric to measure the similarity between 
the target word and its candidate word, such as 
edit-distance (Kashyap and Oommen, 1984; Mays 
et al., 1991). 

But these previous algorithms have a critical li-
mitation: They all corrected word spacing errors 
and spelling errors separately. Word spacing algo-
rithms define the problem as a task for determining 
whether to insert the delimiter between characters 
or not. Since the determination is made according 
to the characters, the algorithms cannot work if the 
characters have spelling errors. Likewise, algo-
rithms for solving spelling error problem cannot 
work well with word spacing errors. 

To cope with the limitation, there is an algo-
rithm proposed for Japanese (Nagata, 1996). Japa-
nese sentence cannot be divided into words, but 
into chunks (bunsetsu in Japanese), like Eojeol in 
Korean. The proposed system is for sentences rec-
ognized by OCR, and it uses character transition 
probabilities and POS (part of speech) tag n-gram. 
However it needs a word dictionary and takes long 
time for searching many character combinations.

We propose a new algorithm which can correct 
both word spacing error and spelling error simulta-
neously for Korean. This algorithm is based on 
noisy-channel model, which uses Jaso3  transition 
probabilities and Eojeol transition probabilities to 
create spelling correction candidates. Candidates 
are increased in number by inserting the blank cha-
racters on the created candidates, which cover the 
spacing error correction candidates. We find the 
best candidate sentence from the networks of Ja-
so/Eojeol candidates. This method decreases the 
size of Eojeol transition pattern dictionary and cor-
rects the patterns which are not in the dictionary. 

The remainder of this paper is as follows: Sec-
tion 2 describes why we use Jaso transition prob-
ability for Korean. Section 3 describes the pro-
posed model in detail. Section 4 provides the ex-
periment results and analyses. Finally, section 5 
presents our conclusion. 

2 Spelling Error Correction with Jaso 
Transition4 Probabilities 

We can use Eumjeol transition probabilities or Jaso 
transition probabilities for spelling error correction 
for Korean. We choose Jaso transition probabilities 
because there are several advantages. Since an 
Eumjeol is a combination of 3 Jasos, the number of 
all possible Eumjeols is much larger than that of all 
possible Jasos. In other words, Jaso-based 
language model is smaller than Eumjeol-based 
language model. Various errors in Eumjeol (even if 
they do not appear as an Eumjeol pattern in a 
training corpus) can be corrected by correction in 
Jaso unit. Also, Jaso transition probabilities can be 
extracted from relatively small corpus. This merit 
is very important since we do not normally have 
such a huge corpus which is very hard to collect, 
since we have to pair the spelling errors with 
corresponding corrections.  

We obtain probabilities differently for each 
case: single Jaso transition case, two Jaso’s transi-
tion case, and more than two Jasos transition case. 

In single Jaso transition case, the spelling errors 
are corrected by only one Jaso transition (e.g. 
같애요 같아요 / ㅐ ㅏ). The case of correcting 
by deleting Jaso is also one of the single Jaso tran-

character due to some causes, such as typographical errors. 

sition case (나와욧 나와요 / ㅅ X5). The Jaso 
transition probabilities are calculated by counting 
the transition frequencies in a training corpus. 

In two Jaso’s transition case, the spelling errors 
are corrected by adjacent two Jasos transition 
(촙오 초보 / ㅂㅇ Xㅂ). In this case, we treat 
two Jaso’s as one transition unit. The transition 
probability calculation is the same as above. 

In more than two Jaso’s transition case, the spel-
ling errors cannot be corrected only by Jaso transi-
tion (걍 그냥). In this case, we treat the whole 
Eojeols as one transition unit, and build an Eojeol 
transition pattern dictionary for these special cases. 

3 A Joint Statistical Model for Word 
Spacing and Spelling Error Correction 

3.1 Problem Definition 

Given a sentence T  which includes both word 
spacing errors and spelling errors, we create 
correction candidates C  from T , and find the best 
candidate that has the highest transition 
probability from C .

In Figure 1, the topmost line is the sequence of 

Jasos of the input sentence. Each Eumjeol in the 
sentence is decomposed into 3 Jasos as above, and 
each Jaso has its own correction candidates. For 
example, Jaso ‘ㅇ’ at 4th column has its candidates 
‘ㅎ’, ‘ㄴ’ and ‘X’. And two jaso’s ‘Xㅋ’ at 13th 
and 14th column has its candidates ‘ㅎㄱ’, 
‘ㅎㅋ’, ’ㄱㅎ’, ’ㅋㅎ’, and ‘ㄱㅇ’. The undermost 
gray square is an Eojeol (which is decomposed into 
Jasos) candidate ‘ㅇㅓXㄸㅓㅎㄱㅔX’ created 
from ‘ㅇㅓXㅋㅔX’. Each jaso candidate has its 
own transition probability, 7)|(log 'ikik jjP , that is

network briefly. At this time, the blank characters 
‘ B ’ and ‘ Φ ’ are inserted into each Eum-
jeol/Eojeol candidates. To find the best path from 
the candidates, we conduct viterbi-search from 
leftmost node corresponding to the beginning of 
the sentence. When Eumjeol/Eojeol candidates are 
selected, the algorithm prunes the candidates ac-
cording to the accumulated probabilities, doing 
beam search. Once the best path is found, the sen-
tence corrected by both spacing and spelling errors 
is extracted by backtracking the path. In Figure 2, 
thick squares represent the nodes selected by the 
best path.

4.1  Corpus Information 

 Table 1: Corpus information 
 
Table 1 shows the information of corpus which is 
used for experiments. All corpora are obtained 
from Korean web chatting site log. Each corpus 
has pair of sentences, sentences containing errors 
and sentences with those errors corrected. Jaso 
transition patterns and Eojeol transition patterns 
are extracted from training corpus. Also, Eumjeol 
n-grams are also obtained as a language model.

4.2  Experiment Results and Analyses 
 We used two separate Eumjeol n-grams as lan-
guage models for experiments. N-gram A is ob-
tained from only training corpus and n-gram B is 
obtained from all training and test corpora. All ac-
curacies are measured based on Eojeol unit. 

Table 2 shows the results of word spacing error 
correction only for the test corpus. 

 Table 2: The word spacing error correction results 
 
The results of both word spacing error and spell-

ing error correction are shown in Table 3. Error 
containing test corpus (the blank characters are all 
deleted) was applied to this evaluation. 

 Table 3: The joint model results 
 
Table 4 shows the results of the same experi-

ment, without deleting the blank characters in the 
test corpus. The experiment shows that our joint 
model has a flexibility of utilizing already existing 
blanks (spacing) in the input sentence. 

 Table 4: The joint model results without deleting the 
exist spaces 

  
As shown above, the performance is dependent 

of the language model (n-gram) performance. Jaso 
transition probabilities can be obtained easily from 
small corpus because the number of Jaso is very 
small, under 100, in contrast with Eumjeol. 

 Using the existing blank information is also an 
important factor. If test sentences have no or few 
blank characters, then we simply use joint algo-
rithm to correct both errors. But when the test sen-
tences already have some blank characters, we can 
use the information since some of the spacing can 
be given by the user. By keeping the blank charac-
ters, we can get better accuracy because blank in-
sertion errors are generally fewer than the blank 
deletion errors in the corpus. 

5 Conclusions 
 We proposed a joint text preprocessing model 

that can correct both word spacing and spelling 
errors simultaneously for Korean. To our best 
knowledge, this is the first model which can handle 
inter-related errors between spacing and spelling in 
Korean. The usage and size of the word dictionar-
ies are decreased by using Jaso statistical prob-
abilities effectively.
