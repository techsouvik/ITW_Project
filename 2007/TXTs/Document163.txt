Abstract
This paper proposes the idea of ranking def-
initions of a person (a set of biographi-
cal facts) to automatically generate “Who
is this?” quizzes. The definitions are or-
dered according to how difficult they make
it to name the person. Such ranking would
enable users to interactively learn about a
person through dialogue with a system with
improved understanding and lasting motiva-
tion, which is useful for educational sys-
tems. In our approach, we train a ranker
that learns from data the appropriate ranking
of definitions based on features that encode
the importance of keywords in a definition
as well as its content. Experimental results
show that our approach is significantly better
in ranking definitions than baselines that use
conventional information retrieval measures
such as tf*idf and pointwise mutual informa-
tion (PMI).

1 Introduction
Appropriate ranking of sentences is important, as
noted in sentence ordering tasks (Lapata, 2003), in
effectively delivering content. Whether the task is
to convey news texts or definitions, the objective is
to make it easier for users to understand the content.
However, just conveying it in an encyclopedia-like
or temporal order may not be the best solution, con-
sidering that interaction between a system and a user
improves understanding (Sugiyama et al., 1999) and
that the cognitive load in receiving information is be-
lieved to correlate with memory fixation (Craik and
Lockhart, 1972).

In this paper, we discuss the idea of ranking defi-
nitions as a way to present people’s biographical in-
formation to users, and propose ranking definitions
to automatically generate a “Who is this?” quiz.
Here, we use the term ‘definitions of a person’ to
mean a short series of biographical facts (See Fig. 1).
The definitions are ordered according to how diffi-
cult they make it to name the person. The ranking

also enables users to easily come up with answer
candidates. The definitions are presented to users
one by one as hints until users give the correct name
(See Fig. 2). Although the interaction would take
time, we could expect improved understanding of
people’s biographical information by users through
their deliberation and the long lasting motivation af-
forded by the entertaining nature of quizzes, which
is important in tutorial tasks (Baylor and Ryu, 2003).

Previous work on definition ranking has used
measures such as tf*idf (Xu et al., 2004) or ranking
models trained to encode the likelihood of a defini-
tion being good (Xu et al., 2005). However, such
measures/models may not be suitable for quiz-style
ranking. For example, a definition having a strong
co-occurrence with a person may not be an easy hint
when it is about a very minor detail. Certain de-
scriptions, such as a person’s birthplace, would have
to come early so that users can easily start guessing
who the person is. In our approach, we train a ranker
that learns from data the appropriate ranking of def-
initions. Note that we only focus on the ranking of
definitions and not on the interaction with users in
this paper. We also assume that the definitions to be
ranked are given.

Section 2 describes the task of ranking definitions,
and Section 3 describes our approach. Section 4 de-
scribes our collection of ranking data and the rank-
ing model training using the ranking support vector
machine (SVM), and Section 5 presents the evalu-
ation results. Section 6 summarizes and mentions
future work.

2 Ranking Definitions for Quizzes

Figure 1 shows a list of definitions of Natsume
Soseki, a famous Japanese novelist, in their original
ranking at the encyclopedic website goo (http://dic-
tionary.goo.ne.jp/) and in the quiz-style ranking we
aim to achieve. Such a ranking would realize a dia-
logue like that in Fig. 2. At the end of the dialogue,
the user would be able to associate the person and
the definitions better, and it is expected that some
new facts could be learned about that person.

Ranking definitions is closely related to defini-
tional question answering and sentence ordering
in multi-document summarization. In definitional
question answering, measures related to information
retrieval (IR), such as tf*idf or pointwise mutual in-
formation (PMI), have been used to rank sentences
or information nuggets (Xu et al., 2004; Sun et al.,
2005). Such measures are used under the assump-
tion that outstanding/co-occurring keywords about a
definiendum characterize that definiendum. How-
ever, this assumption may not be appropriate in quiz-
style ranking; most content words in the definitions
are already important in the IR sense, and strong co-
occurrence may not guarantee high ranks for hints
to be presented later because the hint can be too spe-
cific. An approach to creating a ranking model of
definitions in a supervised manner using machine
learning techniques has been reported (Xu et al.,
2005). However, the model is only used to distin-
guish definitions from non-definitions on the basis
of features related mainly to linguistic styles.

In multi-document summarization, the focus has
been mainly on creating cohesive texts. (Lapata,
2003) uses the probability of words in adjacent sen-
tences as constraints to maximize the coherence of
all sentence-pairs in texts. Although we acknowl-
edge that having cohesive definitions is important,
since we are not creating a single text and the dia-
logue that we aim to achieve would involve frequent
user/system interaction (Fig. 2), we do not deal with
the coherence of definitions in this paper.

3 Approach

Since it is difficult to know in advance what char-
acteristics are important for quiz-style ranking, we
learn the appropriate ranking of definitions from
data. The approach is the same as that of (Xu et al.,
2005) in that we adopt a machine learning approach
for definition ranking, but is different in that what is
learned is a quiz-style ranking of sentences that are
already known to be good definitions.

First, we collect ranking data. For this purpose,
we turn to existing encyclopedias for concise biogra-
phies. Then, we annotate the ranking. Secondly, we
devise a set of features for a definition. Since the
existence of keywords that have high scores in IR-
related measures may suggest easy hints, we incor-
porate the scores of IR-related measures as features
(IR-related features).

Certain words tend to appear before or after oth-
ers in a biographical document to convey particular
information about people (e.g., words describing oc-
cupations at the beginning; those describing works
at the end, etc.) Therefore, we use word positions
within the biography of the person in question as
features (positional features). Biographies can be
found in online resources, such as biography.com
(http://www.biography.com/) and Wikipedia. In ad-
dition, to focus on the particular content of the def-
inition, we use bag-of-words (BOW) features, to-
gether with semantic features (e.g., semantic cate-
gories in Nihongo Goi-Taikei (Ikehara et al., 1997)
or word senses in WordNet) to complement the
sparseness of BOW features. We describe the fea-
tures we created in Section 4.2. Finally, we create
a ranking model using a preference learning algo-

118



rithm, such as the ranking SVM (Joachims, 2002),
which learns ranking by reducing the pairwise rank-
ing error.

4 Experiment

4.1 Data Collection
We collected biographies (in Japanese) from the goo
encyclopedia. We first mined Wikipedia to calcu-
late the PageRankTMof people using the hyper-link
structure. After sorting them in descending order by
the PageRank score, we extracted the top-150 peo-
ple for whom we could find an entry in the goo en-
cyclopedia. Then, 11 annotators annotated rankings
for each of the 150 people individually. The annota-
tors were instructed to rank the definitions assuming
that they were creating a “who is this?” quiz; i.e.,
to place the definition that is the most characteris-
tic of the person in question at the end. The mean
of the Kendall’s coefficients of concordance for the
150 people was sufficiently high at 0.76 with a stan-
dard deviation of 0.13. Finally, taking the means of
ranks given to each definition, we merged the indi-
vidual rankings to create the reference rankings. An
example of a reference ranking is the bottom one in
Fig. 1. There are 958 definition sentences in all, with
each person having approximately 6–7 definitions.

4.2 Deriving Features
We derived our IR-related features based on
Mainichi newspaper articles (1991–2004) and
Wikipedia articles. We used these two different
sources to take into account the difference in the
importance of terms depending on the text. We
also used sentences, sections (for Wikipedia arti-
cles only) and documents as units to calculate doc-
ument frequency, which resulted in the creation of
five frequency tables: (i) Mainichi-Document, (ii)
Mainichi-Sentence, (iii) Wikipedia-Document, (iv)
Wikipedia-Section, and (v) Wikipedia-Sentence.

Using the five frequency tables, we calculated, for
each content word (nouns, verbs, adjectives, and un-
known words) in the definition, (1) frequency (the
number of documents where the word is found), (2)
relative frequency (frequency divided by the maxi-
mum number of documents), (3) co-occurrence fre-
quency (the number of documents where both the
word and the person’s name are found), (4) rela-
tive co-occurrence frequency, and (5) PMI. Then, we
took the minimum, maximum, and mean values of
(1)–(5) for all content words in the definition as fea-
tures, deriving 75 (5 × 5 × 3) features. Then, using
the Wikipedia article (called an entry) for the person

in question, we calculated (1)–(4) within the entry,
and calculated tf*idf scores of words in the defini-
tion using the term frequency in the entry. Again, by
taking the minimum, maximum, and mean values of
(1)–(4) and tf*idf, we yielded 15 (5 × 3) features,
for a total of 90 (75 + 15) IR-related features.

Positional features were derived also using the
Wikipedia entry. For each word in the definition, we
calculated (a) the number of times the word appears
in the entry, (b) the minimum position of the word in
the entry, (c) its maximum position, (d) its mean po-
sition, and (e) the standard deviation of the positions.
Note that positions are either ordinal or relative; i.e.,
the relative position is calculated by dividing the or-
dinal position by the total number of words in the
entry. Then, we took the minimum, maximum, and
mean values of (a)–(e) for all content words in the
definition as features, deriving 30 (5 × 2 (ordinal or
relative positions)× 3) features.

For the BOW features, we first parsed all our
definitions with CaboCha (a Japanese morphologi-
cal/dependency parser, http://chasen.org/˜taku/soft-
ware/cabocha/) and extracted all content words to
make binary features representing the existence of
each content word. There are 2,156 BOW features
in our data.

As for the semantic features, we used the seman-
tic categories in Nihongo Goi-Taikei. Since there are
2,715 semantic categories, we created 2,715 features
representing the existence of each semantic category
in the definition. Semantic categories were assigned
to words in the definition by a morphological ana-
lyzer that comes with ALT/J-E, a Japanese-English
machine translation system (Ikehara et al., 1991).

In total, we have 4,991 features to represent each
definition. We calculated all feature values for all
definitions in our data to be used for the learning.

4.3 Training Ranking Models
Using the reference ranking data, we trained a rank-
ing model using the ranking SVM (Joachims, 2002)
(with a linear kernel) that minimizes the pairwise
ranking error among the definitions of each person.

5 Evaluation

To evaluate the performance of the ranking model,
following (Xu et al., 2004; Sun et al., 2005), we
compared it with baselines that use only the scores
of IR-related and positional features for ranking, i.e.,
sorting. Table 1 shows the performance of the rank-
ing model (by the leave-one-out method, predicting
the ranking of definitions of a person by other peo-

ple’s rankings) and that of the 10 best-performing
baselines. The ranking error is pairwise ranking er-
ror; i.e., the rate of misordered pairs. A descrip-
tive name is given for each baseline. For example,
Wikipedia-Sentence-PMI-max means that we used
the maximum PMI values of content words in the
definition calculated from Wikipedia, with sentence
as the unit for obtaining frequencies.

Our ranking model outperforms all of the base-
lines. McNemar’s test showed that the difference be-
tween the proposed model and the best-performing
baseline is significant (p<0.00001). The results also
show that PMI is more effective in quiz-style rank-
ing than any other measure. The fact that max is im-
portant probably means that the mere existence of a
word that has a high PMI score is enough to raise the
ranking of a hint. It is also interesting that Wikipedia
gives better ranking, which is probably because peo-
ple’s names and related keywords are close to each
other in such descriptive texts.

Analyzing the ranking model trained by the rank-
ing SVM allows us to calculate the weights given to
the features (Hirao et al., 2002). Table 2 shows the
top-10 features in weights in absolute figures when
all samples were used for training. It can be seen
that high PMI values and words/semantic categories
related to government or creation lead to easy hints,
whereas semantic categories, such as birth and oth-
ers (corresponding to the person in ‘a person from
Tokyo’), lead to early hints. This supports our in-
tuitive notion that birthplaces should be presented
early for users to start thinking about a person.

6 Summary and Future Work

This paper proposed ranking definitions of a person
to automatically generate a “Who is this?” quiz.
Using reference ranking data that we created man-
ually, we trained a ranking model using a ranking
SVM based on features that encode the importance
of keywords in a definition as well as its content.

Rank Feature Name Weight
1 Wikipedia-Sentence-PMI-max 0.723
2 SemCat:33 (others/someone) -0.559
3 SemCat:186 (creator) 0.485
4 BOW:bakufu (feudal government) 0.451
5 SemCat:163 (sovereign/ruler/monarch) 0.422
6 Wikipedia-Document-PMI-max 0.409
7 SemCat:2391 (birth) -0.404
8 Wikipedia-Section-PMI-max 0.402
9 SemCat:2595 (unit; e.g., numeral classifier) 0.374

10 SemCat:2606 (plural; e.g., plural form) -0.368

initions by the ranking SVM. SemCat denotes it is
a semantic-category feature with its semantic cate-
gory ID followed by the description of the category

Experimental results show that our ranking model
significantly outperforms baselines that use single
IR-related and positional measures for ranking. We
are currently in the process of building a dialogue
system that uses the quiz-style ranking for definition
presentation. We are planning to examine how the
different rankings affect the understanding and mo-
tivation of users.
