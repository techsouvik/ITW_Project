Abstract 

At least two kinds of relations exist among 
related words: taxonomical relations and 
thematic relations. Both relations identify 
related words useful to language under-
standing and generation, information re-
trieval, and so on. However, although 
words with taxonomical relations are easy 
to identify from linguistic resources such as 
dictionaries and thesauri, words with the-
matic relations are difficult to identify be-
cause they are rarely maintained in linguis-
tic resources. In this paper, we sought to 
extract thematically (non-taxonomically) 
related word sets among words in docu-
ments by employing case-marking particles 
derived from syntactic analysis. We then 
verified the usefulness of word sets with 
non-taxonomical relation that seems to be a 
thematic relation for information retrieval. 

1. Introduction 
Related word sets are useful linguistic resources 
for language understanding and generation, infor-
mation retrieval, and so on. In previous research on 
natural language processing, many methodologies 
for extracting various relations from corpora have 
been developed, such as the “is-a” relation (Hearst 
1992), “part-of” relation (Berland and Charniak 
1999), causal relation (Girju 2003), and entailment 
relation (Geffet and Dagan 2005).  

Related words can be used to support retrieval in 
order to lead users to high-quality information. 
One simple method is to provide additional words 
related to the key words users have input, such as 
an input support function within the Google search 

engine. What kind of relation between the key 
words that have been input and the additional word 
is effective for information retrieval? 

As for the relations among words, at least two 
kinds of relations exist: the taxonomical relation 
and the thematic relation. The former is a relation 
representing the physical resemblance among ob-
jects, which is typically a semantic relation such as 
a hierarchal, synonymic, or antonymic relation; 
the latter is a relation between objects through a 
thematic scene, such as “milk” and “cow” as recol-
lected in the scene “milking a cow,” and “milk” 
and “baby,” as recollected in the scene “giving 
baby milk,” which include causal relation and en-
tailment relation. Wisniewski and Bassok (1999) 
showed that both relations are important in recog-
nizing those objects. However, while taxonomical 
relations are comparatively easy to identify from 
linguistic resources such as dictionaries and 
thesauri, thematic relations are difficult to identify 
because they are rarely maintained in linguistic 
resources. 

In this paper, we sought to extract word sets 
with a thematic relation from documents by em-
ploying case-marking particles derived from syn-
tactic analysis. We then verified the usefulness of 
word sets with non-taxonomical relation that seems 
to be a thematic relation for information retrieval. 

2. Method 
In order to derive word sets that direct users to 
obtain information, we applied a method based on 
the Complementary Similarity Measure (CSM), 
which can determine a relation between two words 
in a corpus by estimating inclusive relations 
between two vectors representing each appearance 
pattern for each words (Yamamoto et al. 2005).  

141



We first extracted word pairs having an inclu-
sive relation between the words by calculating the 
CSM values. Extracted word pairs are expressed 
by a tuple <wi, wj>, where CSM(Vi, Vj) is greater 
than CSM(Vj, Vi) when words wi and wj have each 
appearance pattern represented by each binary vec-
tor Vi and Vj. Then, we connected word pairs with 
CSM values greater than a certain threshold and 
constructed word sets. A feature of the CSM-based 
method is that it can extract not only pairs of re-
lated words but also sets of related words because 
it connects tuples consistently. 

Suppose we have <A, B>, <B, C>, <Z, B>, <C, 
D>, <C, E>, and <C, F> in the order of their CSM 
values, which are greater than the threshold. For 
example, let <B, C> be an initial word set {B, C}. 
First, we find the tuple with the greatest CSM 
value among the tuples in which the word C at the 
tail of the current word set is the left word, and 
connect the right word behind C. In this example, 
word “D” is connected to {B, C} because <C, D> 
has the greatest CSM value among the three tuples 
<C, D>, <C, E>, and <C, F>, making the current 
word set {B, C, D}. This process is repeated until 
no tuples exist. Next, we find the tuple with the 
greatest CSM value among the tuples in which the 
word B at the head of the current word set is the 
right word, and connect the left word before B. 
This process is repeated until no tuples exist. In 
this example, we obtain the word set {A, B, C, D}.  

Finally, we removed ones with a taxonomical 
relation by using thesaurus. The rest of the word 
sets have a non-taxonomical relation — including 
a thematic relation — among the words. We then 
extracted those word sets that do not agree with the 
thesaurus as word sets with a thematic relation. 

3. Experiment 
In our experiment, we used domain-specific Japa-
nese documents within the medical domain 
(225,402 sentences, 10,144 pages, 37MB) gathered 
from the Web pages of a medical school and the 
2005 Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) thesau-
rus 1 . Recently, there has been a study on query 
expansion with this thesaurus as domain informa-
tion (Friberg 2007). 

                                                 
1 The U.S. National Library of Medicine created, maintains, 

and provides the MeSH® thesaurus.  

We extracted word sets by utilizing inclusive re-
lations of the appearance pattern between words 
based on a modified/modifier relationship in 
documents. The Japanese language has case-
marking particles that indicate the semantic rela-
tion between two elements in a dependency rela-
tion. Then, we collected from documents depend-
ency relations matching the following five pat-
terns; “A <no (of)> B,” “P <wo (object)> V,” “Q 
<ga (subject)> V,” “R <ni (dative)> V,” and “S 
<ha (topic)> V,” where A, B, P, Q, R, and S are 
nouns, V is a verb, and <X> is a case-marking par-
ticle. From such collected dependency relations, 
we compiled the following types of experimental 
data; NN-data based on co-occurrence between 
nouns for each sentence, NV-data based on a de-
pendency relation between noun and verb for each 
case-marking particle <wo>, <ga>, <ni>, and <ha>, 
and SO-data based on a collocation between sub-
ject and object that depends on the same verb V 
as the subject. These data are represented with a 
binary vector which corresponds to the appearance 
pattern of a noun and these vectors are used as ar-
guments of CSM. 

We translated descriptors in the MeSH thesaurus 
into Japanese and used them as Japanese medical 
terms. The number of terms appearing in this ex-
periment is 2,557 among them. We constructed 
word sets consisting of these medical terms. Then, 
we chose 977 word sets consisting of three or more 
terms from them, and removed word sets with a 
taxonomical relation from them with the MeSH 
thesaurus in order to obtain the rest 847 word sets 
as word sets with a thematic relation. 

4. Verification 
In verifying the capability of our word sets to re-
trieve Web pages, we examined whether they 
could help limit the search results to more informa-
tive Web pages with Google as a search engine.  

We assume that addition of suitable key words 
to the query reduces the number of pages retrieved 
and the remaining pages are informative pages. 
Based on this assumption, we examined the de-
crease of the retrieved pages by additional key 
words and the contents of the retrieved pages in 
order to verify the availability of our word sets.  

Among 847 word sets, we used 294 word sets in 
which one of the terms is classified into one cate-
gory and the rest are classified into another.

Figure 1. Examples of word sets used to verify. 
Figure 1 shows examples of the word sets, 

where terms in a different category are underlined. 
In retrieving Web pages for verification, we in-

put the terms composed of these word sets into the 
search engine. We created three types of search 
terms from the word set we extracted. Suppose the 
extracted word set is {X1, ..., Xn, Y}, where Xi is 
classified into one category and Y is classified into 
another. The first type uses all terms except the one 
classified into a category different from the others: 
{X1, ..., Xn} removing Y. The second type uses all 
terms except the one in the same category as the 
rest: {X1, ..., Xk-1, Xk+1, ..., Xn} removing Xk from 
Type 1. In our experiment, we removed the term 
Xk with the highest or lowest frequency among Xi. 
The third type uses terms in Type 2 and Y: {X1, ..., 
Xk-1, Xk+1, ..., Xn, Y}. 

In other words, when we consider the terms in 
Type 2 as base key words, the terms in Type 1 are 
key words with the addition of one term having the 
highest or lowest frequency among the terms in the 
same category; i.e., the additional term has a fea-
ture related to frequency in the documents and is 
taxonomically related to other terms. The terms in 
Type 3 are key words with the addition of one term 
in a category different from those of the other 
component terms; i.e., the additional term seems to 
be thematically related — at least non-
taxonomically related — to other terms. 

First, we quantitatively compared the retrieval 
results. We used the estimated number of pages 
retrieved by Google’s search engine. Suppose that 
we first input Type 2 as key words into Google, 
did not satisfy the result extracted, and added one 
word to the previous key words. We then sought to 
determine whether to use Type 1 or Type 3 to ob-
tain more suitable results. The results are shown in 
Figures 2 and 3, which include the results for the 
highest frequency and the lowest frequency, re-
spectively. In these figures, the horizontal axis is 
the number of pages retrieved with Type 2 and the 
vertical axis is the number of pages retrieved when

a certain term is added to Type 2. The circles (•) 
show the retrieval results with additional key word 
related taxonomically (Type 1). The crosses (×) 
show the results with additional key word related 
non-taxonomically (Type 3). The diagonal line 
shows that adding one term to the base key words 
does not affect the number of Web pages retrieved. 

In Figure 2, most crosses fall further below the 
line. This graph indicates that when searching by 
Google, adding a search term related non-
taxonomically tends to make a bigger difference 
than adding a term related taxonomically and with 
high frequency. This means that adding a term re-
lated non-taxonomically to the other terms is cru-
cial to retrieving informative pages; that is, such 
terms are informative terms themselves. Table 1 
shows the number of cases in which term in differ-
ent category decreases the number of hit pages 
more than high frequency term. By this table, we 
found that most of the additional terms with high 
frequency contributed less than additional terms 
related non-taxonomically to decreasing the num-
ber of Web pages retrieved. This means that, in 
comparison to the high frequency terms, which 
might not be so informative in themselves, the 
terms in the other category — related non-
taxonomically — are effective for retrieving useful 
Web pages. 

In Figure 3, most circles fall further below the 
line, in contrast to Figure 2. This indicates that

Table 2. Number of cases in which Type 3 de-

adding a term related taxonomically and with low 
frequency tends to make a bigger difference than 
adding a term with high frequency. Certainly, addi-
tional terms with low frequency would be informa-
tive terms, even though they are related taxonomi-
cally, because they may be rare terms on the Web 
and therefore the number of pages containing the 
term would be small. Table 2 shows the number of 
cases in which term in different category decreases 
the number of hit pages more than low frequency 
term. In comparing these numbers, we found that 
the additional term with low frequency helped to 
reduce the number of Web pages retrieved, making 
no effort to determine the kind of relation the term 
had with the other terms. Thus, the terms with low 
frequencies are quantitatively effective when used 
for retrieval. However, if we compare the results 
retrieved with Type 1 search terms and Type 3 
search terms, it is clear that big differences exist 
between them.  

For example, consider “latency period - erythro-
cyte - hepatic cell” obtained from SO-data in Fig-
ure 1. “Latency period” is classified into a category 
different from the other terms and “hepatic cell” 
has the lowest frequency in this word set. When we 
used all the three terms, we obtained pages related 
to “malaria” at the top of the results and the title of 
the top page was “What is malaria?” in Japanese. 
With “latency period” and “erythrocyte,” we again 
obtained the same page at the top, although it was 

not at the top when we used “erythrocyte” and 
“hepatic cell” which have a taxonomical relation.

10000000 As we showed above, the terms with thematic 
relations with other search terms are effective at 
directing users to informative pages. Quantitatively, 
terms with a high frequency are not effective at 
reducing the number of pages retrieved; qualita-
tively, low frequency terms may not effective to 
direct users to informative pages. We will continue 
our research in order to extract terms in thematic 
relation more accurately and verify the usefulness 
of them more quantitatively and qualitatively. 

5. Conclusion 
We sought to extract word sets with a thematic 
relation from documents by employing case-
marking particles derived from syntactic analysis. 
We compared the results retrieved with terms re-
lated only taxonomically and the results retrieved 
with terms that included a term related non-
taxonomically to the other terms. As a result, we 
found adding term which is thematically related to 
terms that have already been input as key words is 
effective at retrieving informative pages.
