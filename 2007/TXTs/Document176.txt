Abstract

The paper presents an OWL ontology for
HPSG. The HPSG ontology is integrated
with an existing OWL ontology, GOLD, as a
community of practice extension. The basic
ideas are illustrated by visualizations of type
hierarchies for parts of speech.

1 Introduction

The paper presents an OWL ontology for HPSG
(Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar) (Sag et al.,
2003). OWL is the W3C Web Ontology Language
(http://www.w3.org/2004/OWL). An existing ontol-
ogy is used as a starting point: GOLD (Section 2)
is a general ontology for linguistic description. As
HPSG is a more specific linguistic theory, the HPSG
ontology (Section 3) is integrated inside GOLD as
a sub-ontology known as a community of practice
extension (Section 4).

2 GOLD: A General Ontology for
Linguistic Description

GOLD, a General Ontology for Linguistic Descrip-
tion (http://www.linguistics-ontology.org/) (Farrar
and Langendoen, 2003) is an OWL ontology that
aims to capture “the general knowledge of the field
that is usually possessed by a well trained linguist.
This includes knowledge that potentially forms the
basis of any theoretical framework. In particular,
GOLD captures the fundamentals of descriptive lin-
guistics. Examples of such knowledge are ‘a verb
is a part of speech’, ‘gender can be semantically
grounded’, or ‘linguistic expressions realize mor-
phemes’.” (Farrar and Lewis, 2005).

As far as possible GOLD uses language-neutral
and theory-neutral terminology. For instance, parts
of speech are subclasses of gold:GrammaticalUnit
as shown in Figure 1. As GOLD is language-neutral,
a wide range of parts of speech are included. For
example, both Preposition and Postposition are in-
cluded as subclasses of Adposition. The classes in
the OWLViz graphical visualization (on the right in
Figure 1) have been selected from the complete list
in the Asserted Hierarchy (on the left).

Originally GOLD was intended to be neutral
where linguistic theories had divergent views, but
a recent development is the idea of supporting dif-
ferent sub-communities as communities of practice
(Farrar and Lewis, 2005) within the GOLD frame-
work. A community of practice may focus on de-
veloping a consensus in a specific area, for example
in phonology or in Bantu languages. On the other
hand, communities of practice may focus on com-
peting theories, where each sub-community has its
own distinctive terminology and divergent concep-
tualization. In this case, the aim is to capture ex-
plicitly the relationship between the sub-community
view and the overall framework, in the form of a
Community Of Practice Extension (COPE) (Farrar
and Lewis, 2005). A COPE is a sub-ontology that
inherits from, and extends, the overall GOLD on-
tology. Sub-ontology classes are distinguished from
each other by different namespace prefixes, for ex-
ample gold:Noun and hpsg:noun.

3 An OWL Ontology for HPSG

HPSG OWL is an OWL ontology for HPSG that is
currently under development. As the aims of the first
version of the ontology are clarity and acceptability,

169

it carefully follows the standard textbook version of
HPSG by Sag et al. (2003). This also means that the
first version is English-specific, as the core gram-
mars presented in the textbook are English-specific.

In HPSG OWL, parts of speech are subclasses of
hpsg:pos, as shown in Figure 2. As this version is
English-specific, it has prepositions (hpsg:prep) but
not postpositions. Parts of speech that have agree-
ment features (in English) form a distinct subclass
hpsg:agr-pos including hpsg:det (determiner) and
hpsg:verb. Within hpsg:agr-pos, hpsg:comp (com-
plementizer) and hpsg:noun form a further subclass
hpsg:nominal. This particular conceptualization of
the type hierarchy is specific to (Sag et al., 2003).

The Protégé-OWL (http://protege.stanford.edu)
ontology editor supports both visual construction
and visual editing of the hierarchy. For example, if
hpsg:adj had agreement features, it could be moved
under hpsg:agr-pos by a simple drag-and-drop (in

the Asserted Hierarchy pane on the left). Both the
visualization (in the OWLViz pane on the right) and
the underlying OWL statements (not shown) are au-
tomatically generated. The grammar writer does not
edit OWL statements directly.

This is a significant advantage of the new technol-
ogy over current grammar development tools. For
example, LKB (Copestake, 2002) can produce a vi-
sualization of the type hierarchy from the underlying
Type Definition Language (TDL) statements, but the
hierarchy can only be modified by textually editing
the TDL statements.

4 A Community of Practice Extension

HPSG COPE is a community of practice extension
that integrates the HPSG ontology within GOLD.
The COPE is an OWL ontology that imports both
the GOLD and the HPSG ontologies. Apart from
the import statements, the COPE consists entirely of

170



Figure 2: Parts of speech in HPSG

rdfs:subClassOf and rdfs:subPropertyOf statements.
HPSG COPE defines HPSG classes as subclasses of
GOLD classes and HPSG properties as subproper-
ties of GOLD properties.

In the COPE, parts of speech in HPSG are sub-
sumed by appropriate parts of speech in GOLD,
as shown in Figure 3. In some cases this is
straightforward, for example hpsg:adj is mapped to
gold:Adjective. In other cases, the HPSG theory-
specific terminology differs significantly from the
theory-neutral terminology in GOLD. Some of
the mappings are based on definitions of the
HPSG terms given in a glossary in (Sag et al.,
2003), for example the mapping of hpsg:conj
(conjunction) to gold:CoordinatingConnective and
the mapping of hpsg:comp (complementizer) to
gold:SubordinatingConnective.

Properties in HPSG OWL are defined by HPSG
COPE as subproperties of GOLD properties. For ex-

ample, the HPSG OWL class hpsg:sign (Sag et al.,
2003) (p. 475) properties:

PHON type: list (a sequence of word forms)
SYN type: gram-cat (a grammatical category)
SEM type: sem-struc (a semantic structure)

are mapped to the GOLD class gold:LinguisticSign
properties:

hasForm Range: PhonologicalUnit
hasGrammar Range: GrammaticalUnit
hasMeaning Range: SemanticUnit

by the HPSG COPE rdfs:subPropertyOf definitions:
hpsg:PHON subproperty of gold:hasForm
hpsg:SYN subproperty of gold:hasGrammar
hpsg:SEM subproperty of gold:hasMeaning

5 Conclusion

The paper has described an initial version of an
OWL ontology for HPSG, together with an approach
to integrating it with GOLD as a community of prac-

tice extension. Perhaps a rigorous foundation of
typed feature structures and a clear type hierarchy
makes HPSG more amenable to expression as an on-
tology than other linguistic theories.

Protégé-OWL supports visual development and
visual editing of the ontology. This is a significant
practical advantage over existing grammar develop-
ment tools. OWLViz provides graphical visualiza-
tions of any part of the ontology.

OWL DL (Description Logic) reasoners can be
run inside Protégé to check consistency and to do
cross-classification. One current research topic is
how to exploit reasoners to perform automatically
the kind of cross-classification that is widely used in
HPSG linguistic analyses.

Another current topic is how to implement HPSG
lexical rules and grammar rules in the ontology. An
interesting possibility is to use the W3C Semantic
Web Rule Language, SWRL (Wilcock, 2006).
