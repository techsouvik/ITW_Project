Abstract

Data sparseness is one of the factors that de-
grade statistical machine translation (SMT).
Existing work has shown that using morpho-
syntactic information is an effective solu-
tion to data sparseness. However, fewer ef-
forts have been made for Chinese-to-English
SMT with using English morpho-syntactic
analysis. We found that while English is
a language with less inflection, using En-
glish lemmas in training can significantly
improve the quality of word alignment that
leads to yield better translation performance.
We carried out comprehensive experiments
on multiple training data of varied sizes to
prove this. We also proposed a new effec-
tive linear interpolation method to integrate
multiple homologous features of translation
models.

1 Introduction

Raw parallel data need to be preprocessed in the
modern phrase-based SMT before they are aligned
by alignment algorithms, one of which is the well-
known tool, GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003), for
training IBM models (1-4). Morphological analy-
sis (MA) is used in data preprocessing, by which the
surface words of the raw data are converted into a
new format. This new format can be lemmas, stems,
parts-of-speech and morphemes or mixes of these.
One benefit of using MA is to ease data sparseness
that can reduce the translation quality significantly,
especially for tasks with small amounts of training
data.

Some published work has shown that apply-
ing morphological analysis improved the quality of

SMT (Lee, 2004; Goldwater and McClosky, 2005).
We found that all this earlier work involved exper-
iments conducted on translations from highly in-
flected languages, such as Czech, Arabic, and Span-
ish, to English. These researchers also provided de-
tailed descriptions of the effects of foreign language
morpho-syntactic analysis but presented no specific
results to show the effect of English morphologi-
cal analysis. To the best of our knowledge, there
have been no papers related to English morpholog-
ical analysis for Chinese-to-English (CE) transla-
tions even though the CE translation has been the
main track for many evaluation campaigns includ-
ing NIST MT, IWSLT and TC-STAR, where only
simple tokenization or lower-case capitalization has
been applied to English preprocessing. One possi-
ble reason why English morphological analysis has
been neglected may be that English is less inflected
to the extent that MA may not be effective. How-
ever, we found this assumption should not be taken-
for-granted.

We studied what effect English lemmatization had
on CE translation. Lemmatization is shallow mor-
phological analysis, which uses a lexical entry to re-
place inflected words. For example, the three words,
doing, did and done, are replaced by one word, do.
They are all mapped to the same Chinese transla-
tions. As a result, it eases the problem with sparse
data, and retains word meanings unchanged. It is
not impossible to improve word alignment by using
English lemmatization.

We determined what effect lemmatization had in
experiments using data from the BTEC (Paul, 2006)
CSTAR track. We collected a relatively large cor-
pus of more than 678,000 sentences. We conducted
comprehensive evaluations and used multiple trans-

181



lation metrics to evaluate the results. We found that
our approach of using lemmatization improved both
the word alignment and the quality of SMT with
a small amounts of training data, and, while much
work indicates that MA is useless in training large
amounts of data (Lee, 2004), our intensive exper-
iments proved that the chance to get a better MT
quality using lemmatization is higher than that with-
out it for large amounts of training data.

On the basis of successful use of lemmatization
translation, we propose a new linear interpolation
method by which we integrate the homologous fea-
tures of translation models of the lemmatization and
non-lemmatization system. We found the integrated
model improved all the components’ performance in
the translation.

2 Moses training for system with
lemmatization and without

We used Moses to carry out the expriments. Moses
is the state of the art decoder for SMT. It is an ex-
tension of Pharaoh (Koehn et al., 2003), and sup-
ports factor training and decoding. Our idea can
be easily implemented by Moses. We feed Moses
English words with two factors: surface word and
lemma. The only difference in training with lemma-
tization from that without is the alignment factor.
The former uses Chinese surface words and English
lemmas as the alignment factor, but the latter uses
Chinese surface words and English surface words.
Therefore, the lemmatized English is only used in
word alignment. All the other options of Moses are
same for both the lemmatization translation and non-
lemmatization translation.

We use the tool created by (Minnen et al., 2001) to
complete the morphological analysis of English. We
had to make an English part-of-speech (POS) tag-
ger that is compatible with the CLAWS-5 tagset to
use this tool. We use our in-house tagset and En-
glish tagged corpus to train a statistical POS tagger
by using the maximum entropy principle. Our tagset
contains over 200 POS tags, most of which are con-
sistent to the CLAWS-5. The tagger achieved 93.7%
accuracy for our test set.

We use the default features defined by Pharaoh
in the phrase-based log-linear models i.e., a target
language model, five translation models, and one

distance-based distortion model. The weighting pa-
rameters of these features were optimized in terms
of BLEU by the approach of minimum error rate
training (Och, 2003).

The data for training and test are from the
IWSLT06 CSTAR track that uses the Basic Travel
Expression Corpus (BTEC). The BTEC corpus are
relatively larger corpus for travel domain. We use
678,748 Chinese/English parallel sentences as the
training data in the experiments. The number of
words are about 3.9M and 4.4M for Chinese and En-
glish respectively. The number of unique words for
English is 28,709 before lemmatization and 24,635
after lemmatization. A 15%-20% reduction in vo-
cabulary is obtained by the lemmatization. The test
data are the one used in IWSLT06 evaluation. It
contains 500 Chinese sentences. The test data of
IWSLT05 are the development data for tuning the
weighting parameters. Multiple references are used
for computing the automatic metrics.

3 Experiments

3.1 Regular test

The purpose of the regular tests is to find what ef-
fect lemmatization has as the amount of training
data increases. We used the data from the IWSLT06
CSTAR track. We started with 50,000 (50 K) of
data, and gradually added more training data from
a 678 K corpus to this. We applied the methods
in Section 2 to train the non-lemmatized translation
and lemmatized translation systems. The results are
listed in Table 1. We use the alignment error rate
(AER) to measure the alignment performance, and
the two popular automatic metric, BLEU1 and ME-
TEOR2 to evaluate the translations. To measure the
word alignment, we manually aligned 100 parallel
sentences from the BTEC as the reference file. We
use the “sure” links and the “possible” links to de-
note the alignments. As shown in Table 1, we found
our approach improved word alignment uniformly
from small amounts to large amounts of training
data. The maximal AER reduction is up to 27.4%
for the 600K. However, we found some mixed trans-
lation results in terms of BLEU. The lemmatized

translations did not outperform the non-lemmatized
ones uniformly. They did for small amounts of data,
i.e., 50 K and 100 K, and for large amounts, 500 K
and 600 K. However, they failed for 300 K and 400
K.

The translations were under the statistical signif-
icance test by using the bootStrap scripts3. The re-
sults giving the medians and confidence intervals are
shown in Table 2, where the numbers indicate the
median, the lower and higher boundary at 95% con-
fidence interval. we found the lemma systems were
confidently better than the nonlem systems for the
50K and 600K, but didn’t for other data sizes.

This experiments proved that our proposed ap-
proach improved the qualities of word alignments
that lead to the translation improvement for the 50K,
100K, 500K and 600K. In particular, our results
revealed large amounts of data of 500 K and 600

K was improved by the lemmatization while it has
been found impossible in most published results.
However, data of 300 K and 400 K worsen trans-
lations achieved by the lemmatization4. In what fol-
lows, we discuss a method of random sampling of
creating multiple corpora of varied sizes to see ro-
bustness of our approach and re-investigate the re-
sults of the 300K and 400K.

3.2 Random sampling test

In this section, we use a method of random extrac-
tion to generate new multiple training data for each
corpus of one definite size. The new data are ex-
tracted from the whole corpus of 678 K randomly.
We generate ten new corpora for 100 K, 300 K,
and 400 K data and six new corpora for the 678 K
data. Thus, we create eleven and seven corpora of
varied sizes if the corpora in the last experiments
are counted. We use the same method as in Sec-
tion 2 for each generated corpus to construct sys-
tems to compare non-lemmatization and lemmati-
zation. The systems are evaluated again using the
same test data. The results are listed in Table 3
and Figure 1. Table 3 shows the “scoreboard” of
non-lemmatized and lemmatized results in terms of
BLEU. If its score for the lemma system is higher
than that for the nonlem system, the former earns
one point; if equal, each earns 0.5; otherwise, the
nonlem earns one point. As we can see from the ta-
ble, the results for the lemma system are better than
those for the nonlem system for the 100K in 10 of
the total 11 corpora. Of the total 40 random corpora,
the lemma systems outperform the nonlem systems
in 27 times.

By analyzing the results from Tables 1 and 3, we
can arrive at some conclusions. The lemma systems
outperform the nonlem for training corpora less than

cance test, the medians of 300K and 400K were lowered by
the lemmatization

100 K. The BLEU score favors the lemma system
overwhelmingly for this size. When the amount of
training data is increased up to 600 K, the lemma
still beat the nonlem system in most tests while the
number of success by the nonlem system increases.
This random test, as a complement to the last ex-
periment, reveals that the lemma either performs the
same or better than the nonlem system for training
data of any size. Therefore, the lemma system is
slightly better than the nonlem in general.

Figure 1 illustrates the BLEU scores for the
“lemma(L)” and “nonlem(NL)” systems for ran-
domly extracted corpora. A higher number of points
is obtained by the lemma system than the nonlem for
each corpus.

4 Effect of linear interpolation of features

We generated translation models for lemmatization
translation and non-lemmatization translation. We
found some features of the translation models could
be added linearly. For example, phrase translation
model p(e| f ) can be calculated as,

p(e| f ) = α1 pl(e| f ) + α2 pnl(e| f )

where pl(e| f ) and pnl(e| f ) is the phrase translation
models corresponding to the lemmatization system
and non-lemma system. α1 + α2 = 1. αs can be
obtained by maximizing likelihood or BLEU scores
of a development data. But we used the same val-
ues for all the α. p(e| f ) is the phrase translation
model after linear interpolation. Besides the phrase
translation model, we used this approach to integrate

Table 4: Effect of linear interpolation

the three other features: phrase inverse probability,
lexical probability, and lexical inverse probability.
We tested this integration using the open track of
IWSLT 2006, a small task track. The BLEU scores
are shown in Table 4. An improvement over both of
the systems were observed.

5 Conclusions

We proposed a new approach of using lemmatiza-
tion and linear interpolation of homologous features
in SMT. The principal idea is to use lemmatized En-
glish for the word alignment. Our approach was
proved effective for the BTEC Chinese to English
translation. It is significant in particular that we
have target language, English, as the lemmatized ob-
ject because it is less usual in SMT. Nevertheless,
we found our approach significantly improved word
alignment and qualities of translations.
