Abstract 

Event-based summarization extracts and 
organizes summary sentences in terms of 
the events that the sentences describe. In 
this work, we focus on semantic relations 
among event terms. By connecting terms 
with relations, we build up event term 
graph, upon which relevant terms are 
grouped into clusters. We assume that each 
cluster represents a topic of documents. 
Then two summarization strategies are 
investigated, i.e. selecting one term as the 
representative of each topic so as to cover 
all the topics, or selecting all terms in one 
most significant topic so as to highlight the 
relevant information related to this topic. 
The selected terms are then responsible to 
pick out the most appropriate sentences 
describing them. The evaluation of 
clustering-based summarization on DUC 
2001 document sets shows encouraging 
improvement over the well-known 
PageRank-based summarization. 

1 Introduction 
Event-based extractive summarization has emerged 
recently (Filatova and Hatzivassiloglou, 2004). It 
extracts and organizes summary sentences in terms 
of the events that sentences describe.  

We follow the common agreement that event 
can be formulated as “[Who] did [What] to [Whom] 
[When] and [Where]” and “did [What]” denotes 
the key element of an event, i.e. the action within 
the formulation. We approximately define the 
verbs and action nouns as the event terms which 
can characterize or partially characterize the event 
occurrences. 

Most existing event-based summarization 
approaches rely on the statistical features derived 
from documents and generally associated with 
single events, but they neglect the relations among 
events. However, events are commonly related 
with one another especially when the documents to 
be summarized are about the same or very similar 
topics. Li et al (2006) report that the improved 
performance can be achieved by taking into 
account of event distributional similarities, but it 
does not benefit much from semantic similarities. 
This motivated us to further investigate whether 
event-based summarization can take advantage of 
the semantic relations of event terms, and most 
importantly, how to make use of those relations. 
Our idea is grouping the terms connected by the 
relations into the clusters, which are assumed to 
represent some topics described in documents. 

In the past, various clustering approaches have 
been investigated in document summarization. 
Hatzivassiloglou et al (2001) apply clustering 
method to organize the highly similar paragraphs 
into tight clusters based on primitive or composite 
features. Then one paragraph per cluster is selected 
to form the summary by extraction or by 
reformulation. Zha (2002) uses spectral graph 
clustering algorithm to partition sentences into 
topical groups. Within each cluster, the saliency 
scores of terms and sentences are calculated using 
mutual reinforcement principal, which assigns high 
salience scores to the sentences that contain many 
terms with high salience scores. The sentences and 
key phrases are selected by their saliency scores to 
generate the summary. The similar work based on 
topic or event is also reported in (Guo and Stylios, 
2005).

The granularity of clustering units mentioned 
above is rather coarse, either sentence or paragraph. 
In this paper, we define event term as clustering 

185



unit and implement a clustering algorithm based on 
semantic relations. We extract event terms from 
documents and construct the event term graph by 
linking terms with the relations. We then regard a 
group of closely related terms as a topic and make 
the following two alterative assumptions:  

(1) If we could find the most significant topic as 
the main topic of documents and select all terms in 
it, we could summarize the documents with this 
main topic.  

(2) If we could find all topics and pick out one 
term as the representative of each topic, we could 
obtain the condensed version of topics described in 
the documents.  

Based on these two assumptions, a set of cluster 
ranking, term selection and ranking and sentence 
extraction strategies are developed. The remainder 
of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 
introduces the proposed extractive summarization 
approach based on event term clustering. Section 3 
presents experiments and evaluations. Finally, 
Section 4 concludes the paper. 

2 Summarization Based on Event Term 
Clustering 

2.1 Event Term Graph 
We introduce VerbOcean (Chklovski and Pantel, 
2004), a broad-coverage repository of semantic 
verb relations, into event-based summarization. 
Different from other thesaurus like WordNet, 
VerbOcean provides five types of semantic verb 
relations at finer level. This just fits in with our 
idea to introduce event term relations into 
summarization. Currently, only the stronger-than 
relation is explored. When two verbs are similar, 
one may denote a more intense, thorough, 
comprehensive or absolute action. In the case of 
change-of-state verbs, one may denote a more 
complete change. This is identified as the stronger-
than relation in (Timothy and Patrick, 2004). In 
this paper, only stronger-than is taken into account 
but we consider extending our future work with 
other applicable relations types.  

The event term graph connected by term 
semantic relations is defined formally as 

, where V is a set of event terms and E 
is a set of relation links connecting the event terms 
in V. The graph is directed if the semantic relation 
has the characteristic of the asymmetric. Otherwise, 

it is undirected. Figure 1 shows a sample of event 
term graph built from one DUC 2001 document set. 
It is a directed graph as the stronger-than relation 
in VerbOcean exhibits the conspicuous asymmetric 
characteristic. For example, “fight” means to 
attempt to harm by blows or with weapons, while 
“resist” means to keep from giving in. Therefore, a 
directed link from “fight” to “resist” is shown in 
the following Figure 1.  

),( EVG =

Relations link terms together and form the event 
term graph. Based upon it, term significance is 
evaluated and in turn sentence is judged whether to 
be extracted in the summary.

2.2 Event Term Clustering 
Note that in Figure 1, some linked event terms, 
such as “kill”, “rob”, “threaten” and “infect”, are 
semantically closely related. They may describe 
the same or similar topic somehow. In contrast, 
“toler”, “resist” and “fight” are clearly involved in 
another topic; although they are also reachable 
from “kill”. Based on this observation, a clustering 
algorithm is required to group the similar and 
related event terms into the cluster of the topic.  

In this work, event terms are clustered by the 
DBSCAN, a density-based clustering algorithm 
proposed in (Easter et al, 1996). The key idea 
behind it is that for each term of a cluster the 
neighborhood of a given radius has to contain at 
least a minimum number of terms, i.e. the density 
in the neighborhood has to exceed some threshold. 
By using this algorithm, we need to figure out 
appropriate values for two basic parameters, 
namely, Eps (denoting the searching radius from 
each term) and MinPts (denoting the minimum 
number of terms in the neighborhood of the term). 
We assign one semantic relation step to Eps since 
there is no clear distance concept in the event term 

186



graph. The value of Eps is experimentally set in 
our experiments. We also make some modification 
on Easter’s DBSCAN in order to accommodate to 
our task.  

Figure 2 shows the seven term clusters 
generated by the modified DBSCAN clustering 
algorithm from the graph in Figure 1. We represent 
each cluster by the starting event term in bold font.

where  is the degree of the term t  in the term 
graph. C  is the set of term clusters obtained by the 
modified DBSCAN clustering algorithm and  is 
the ith one. Obviously, the significance of the 
cluster is calculated from global point of view, i.e. 
the sum of the degree of all terms in the same 
cluster is divided by the total degree of the terms in 
all clusters.

2.4 Term Selection  and Ranking 
Representative terms are selected according to the 
significance of the event terms calculated within 
each cluster (i.e. from local point of view) or in all 
clusters (i.e. from global point of view) by  

LOCAL:  or ∑

Then two strategies are developed to select the 
representative terms from the clusters.  

(1) One Cluster All Terms (OCAT) selects all 
terms within the first rank cluster. The selected 

terms are then ranked according to their 
significance.  

(2) One Term All Cluster (OTAC) selects one 
most significant term from each cluster. Notice that 
because terms compete with each other within 
clusters, it is not surprising to see )()( 21 tsttst <  
even when , . To 
address this problem, the representative terms are 
ranked according to the significance of the clusters 
they belong to.  

)()( 21 csccsc > ),( 2211 ctct ∈∈

2.5 Sentence Evaluation and Extraction 
A representative event term may associate to more 
than one sentence. We extract only one of them as 
the description of the event. To this end, sentences 
are compared according to the significance of the 
terms in them. MAX compares the maximum 
significance scores, while SUM compares the sum 
of the significance scores. The sentence with either 
higher MAX or SUM wins the competition and is 
picked up as a candidate summary sentence. If the 
sentence in the first place has been selected by 
another term, the one in the second place is chosen. 
The ranks of these candidates are the same as the 
ranks of the terms they are selected for. Finally, 
candidate sentences are selected in the summary 
until the length limitation is reached. 

3 Experiments 
We evaluate the proposed approaches on DUC 
2001 corpus which contains 30 English document 
sets. There are 431 event terms on average in each 
document set. The automatic evaluation tool, 
ROUGE (Lin and Hovy, 2003), is run to evaluate 
the quality of the generated summaries (200 words 
in length). The tool presents three values including 
unigram-based ROUGE-1, bigram-based ROUGE-
2 and ROUGE-W which is based on longest 
common subsequence weighted by the length. 

Google’s PageRank (Page and Brin, 1998) is 
one of the most popular ranking algorithms. It is 
also graph-based and has been successfully applied 
in summarization. Table 1 lists the result of our 
implementation of PageRank based on event terms. 
We then compare it with the results of the event 
term clustering-based approaches illustrated in 
Table 2.

Table 2. Evaluations of Clustering-based  
Summarization 

The experiments show that both assumptions are 
reasonable. It is encouraging to find that our event 
term clustering-based approaches could outperform 
the PageRank-based approach. The results based 
on the second assumption are even better. This 
suggests indeed there is a main topic in a DUC 
2001 document set. 

4 Conclusion 
In this paper, we put forward to apply clustering 
algorithm on the event term graph connected by 
semantic relations derived from external linguistic 
resource. The experiment results based on our two 
assumptions are encouraging. Event term 
clustering-based approaches perform better than 
PageRank-based approach. Current approaches 
simply utilize the degrees of event terms in the 
graph. In the future, we would like to further 
explore and integrate more information derived 
from documents in order to achieve more 
significant results using the event term clustering-
based approaches.
