Abstract 

This paper describes our work on build-
ing Part-of-Speech (POS) tagger for 
Bengali. We have use Hidden Markov 
Model (HMM) and Maximum Entropy 
(ME) based stochastic taggers. Bengali is 
a morphologically rich language and our 
taggers make use of morphological and 
contextual information of the words.  
Since only a small labeled training set is 
available (45,000 words), simple stochas-
tic approach does not yield very good re-
sults. In this work, we have studied the 
effect of using a morphological analyzer 
to improve the performance of the tagger. 
We find that the use of morphology helps 
improve the accuracy of the tagger espe-
cially when less amount of tagged cor-
pora are available. 

1 Introduction 
Part-of-Speech (POS) taggers for natural lan-
guage texts have been developed using linguistic 
rules, stochastic models as well as a combination 
of both (hybrid taggers). Stochastic models (Cut-
ting et al., 1992; Dermatas et al., 1995; Brants, 
2000) have been widely used in POS tagging for 
simplicity and language independence of the 
models. Among stochastic models, bi-gram and 
tri-gram Hidden Markov Model (HMM) are 
quite popular. Development of a high accuracy 
stochastic tagger requires a large amount of an-
notated text. Stochastic taggers with more than 
95% word-level accuracy have been developed 
for English, German and other European Lan-
guages, for which large labeled data is available. 
Our aim here is to develop a stochastic POS tag-
ger for Bengali but we are limited by lack of a 
large annotated corpus for Bengali. Simple 
HMM models do not achieve high accuracy 
when the training set is small. In such cases, ad-

ditional information may be coded into the 
HMM model to achieve higher accuracy (Cutting 
et al., 1992). The semi-supervised model de-
scribed in Cutting et al. (1992), makes use of 
both labeled training text and some amount of 
unlabeled text. Incorporating a diverse set of 
overlapping features in a HMM-based tagger is 
difficult and complicates the smoothing typically 
used for such taggers. In contrast, methods based 
on Maximum Entropy (Ratnaparkhi, 1996), 
Conditional Random Field (Shrivastav, 2006) 
etc. can deal with diverse, overlapping features. 

1.1 Previous Work on Indian Language 
POS Tagging 

Although some work has been done on POS tag-
ging of different Indian languages, the systems 
are still in their infancy due to resource poverty. 
Very little work has been done previously on 
POS tagging of Bengali. Bengali is the main 
language spoken in Bangladesh, the second most 
commonly spoken language in India, and the 
fourth most commonly spoken language in the 
world. Ray et al. (2003) describes a morphology-
based disambiguation for Hindi POS tagging. 
System using a decision tree based learning algo-
rithm (CN2) has been developed for statistical 
Hindi POS tagging (Singh et al., 2006). A rea-
sonably good accuracy POS tagger for Hindi has 
been developed using Maximum Entropy 
Markov Model (Dalal et al., 2007). The system 
uses linguistic suffix and POS categories of a 
word along with other contextual features. 

2 Our Approach 

The problem of POS tagging can be formally 
stated as follows. Given a sequence of words w1 
… wn, we want to find the corresponding se-
quence of tags t1 … tn, drawn from a set of tags T. 
We use a tagset of 40 tags1. In this work, we ex-
plore supervised and semi-supervised bi-gram

HMM and a ME based model. The bi-gram as-
sumption states that the POS-tag of a word de-
pends on the current word and the POS tag of the 
previous word. An ME model estimates the prob-
abilities based on the imposed constraints. Such 
constraints are derived from the training data, 
maintaining some relationship between features 
and outcomes. The most probable tag sequence 
for a given word sequence satisfies equation (1) 
and (2) respectively for HMM and ME model:

Here, hi is the context for word wi. Since the ba-
sic bigram model of HMM as well as the equiva-
lent ME models do not yield satisfactory accu-
racy, we wish to explore whether other available 
resources like a morphological analyzer can be 
used appropriately for better accuracy.  

2.1 HMM and ME based Taggers 
Three taggers have been implemented based on 
bigram HMM and ME model. The first tagger 
(we shall call it HMM-S) makes use of the su-
pervised HMM model parameters, whereas the 
second tagger (we shall call it HMM-SS) uses 
the semi supervised model parameters. The third 
tagger uses ME based model to find the most 
probable tag sequence for a given sequence of 
words.  

 
In order to further improve the tagging accuracy, 
we use a Morphological Analyzer (MA) and in-
tegrate morphological information with the mod-
els. We assume that the POS-tag of a word w can 
take values from the set TMA(w), where TMA(w) is 
computed by the Morphological Analyzer. Note 
that the size of TMA(w) is much smaller than T. 
Thus, we have a restricted choice of tags as well 
as tag sequences for a given sentence. Since the 
correct tag t for w is always in TMA(w) (assuming 
that the morphological analyzer is complete), it is 
always possible to find out the correct tag se-
quence for a sentence even after applying the 
morphological restriction. Due to a much re-
duced set of possibilities, this model is expected 
to perform better for both the HMM (HMM-S 
and HMM-SS) and ME models even when only a 
small amount of labeled training text is available. 
We shall call these new models HMM-S+MA, 
HMM-SS+ MA and ME+MA.  
 

Our MA has high accuracy and coverage but it 
still has some missing words and a few errors. 
For the purpose of these experiments we have 
made sure that all words of the test set are pre-
sent in the root dictionary that an MA uses. 
 
While MA helps us to restrict the possible choice 
of tags for a given word, one can also use suffix 
information (i.e., the sequence of last few charac-
ters of a word) to further improve the models. 
For HMM models, suffix information has been 
used during smoothing of emission probabilities, 
whereas for ME models, suffix information is 
used as another type of feature. We shall denote 
the models with suffix information with a ‘+suf’ 
marker. Thus, we have – HMM-S+suf, HMM-
S+suf+MA, HMM-SS+suf etc. 

2.1.1 Unknown Word Hypothesis in HMM 
The transition probabilities are estimated by lin-
ear interpolation of unigrams and bigrams. For 
the estimation of emission probabilities add-one 
smoothing or suffix information is used for the 
unknown words. If the word is unknown to the 
morphological analyzer, we assume that the 
POS-tag of that word belongs to any of the open 
class grammatical categories (all classes of 
Noun, Verb, Adjective, Adverb and Interjection). 

2.1.2 Features of the ME Model 
Experiments were carried out to find out the 
most suitable binary valued features for the POS 
tagging in the ME model. The main features for 
the POS tagging task have been identified based 
on the different possible combination of the 
available word and tag context. The features also 
include prefix and suffix up to length four. We 
considered different combinations from the fol-
lowing set for obtaining the best feature set for 
the POS tagging task with the data we have.

Forty different experiments were conducted tak-
ing several combinations from set ‘F’ to identify 
the best suited feature set for the POS tagging 
task. From our empirical analysis we found that 
the combination of contextual features (current 
word and previous tag), prefixes and suffixes of 
length ≤ 4 gives the best performance for the ME 
model. It is interesting to note that the inclusion 
of prefix and suffix for all words gives better 
result instead of using only for rare words as is 
described in Ratnaparkhi (1996). This can be 
explained by the fact that due to small amount of 
annotated data, a significant number of instances

are not found for most of the word of the 
language vocabulary.   

3 Experiments 

We have a total of 12 models as described in 
subsection 2.1 under different stochastic tagging 
schemes. The same training text has been used to 
estimate the parameters for all the models. The 
model parameters for supervised HMM and ME 
models are estimated from the annotated text 
corpus. For semi-supervised learning, the HMM 
learned through supervised training is considered 
as the initial model. Further, a larger unlabelled 
training data has been used to re-estimate the 
model parameters of the semi-supervised HMM. 
The experiments were conducted with three dif-
ferent sizes (10K, 20K and 40K words) of the 
training data to understand the relative perform-
ance of the models as we keep on increasing the 
size of the annotated data.   

3.1 Training Data 
The training data includes manually annotated 
3625 sentences (approximately 40,000 words) 
for both supervised HMM and ME model. A 
fixed set of 11,000 unlabeled sentences (ap-
proximately 100,000 words) taken from CIIL 
corpus 2  are used to re-estimate the model pa-
rameter during semi-supervised learning. It has 
been observed that the corpus ambiguity (mean 
number of possible tags for each word) in the 
training text is 1.77 which is much larger com-
pared to the European languages (Dermatas et 
al., 1995).  

3.2 Test Data 
All the models have been tested on a set of ran-
domly drawn 400 sentences (5000 words) dis-
joint from the training corpus. It has been noted 
that 14% words in the open testing text are un-
known with respect to the training set, which is 
also a little higher compared to the European 
languages (Dermatas et al., 1995) 

3.3 Results 
We define the tagging accuracy as the ratio of 
the correctly tagged words to the total number of 
words. Table 1 summarizes the final accuracies 
achieved by different learning methods with the 
varying size of the training data. Note that the 
baseline model (i.e., the tag probabilities depends

76.8%.

3.4 Observations 
We find that in both the HMM based models 
(HMM-S and HMM-SS), the use of suffix in-
formation as well as the use of a morphological 
analyzer improves the accuracy of POS tagging 
with respect to the base models. The use of MA 
gives better results than the use of suffix infor-
mation. When we use both suffix information as 
well as MA, the results is even better. 
 
HMM-SS does better than HMM-S when very 
little tagged data is available, for example, when 
we use 10K training corpus. However, the accu-
racy of the semi-supervised HMM models are 
slightly poorer than that of the supervised HMM 
models for moderate size training data and use of 
suffix information. This discrepancy arises due 
to the over-fitting of the supervised models in the 
case of small training data; the problem is allevi-
ated with the increase in the annotated data. 
 
As we have noted already the use of MA and/or 
suffix information improves the accuracy of the 
POS tagger. But what is significant to note is that 
the percentage of improvement is higher when 
the amount of training data is less. The HMM-
S+suf model gives an improvement of around 
18%, 9% and 6% over the HMM-S model for 
10K, 20K and 40K training data respectively. 
Similar trends are observed in the case of the 
semi-supervised HMM and the ME models. The 
use of morphological restriction (HMM-S+MA) 
gives an improvement of 25%, 14% and 9% re-
spectively over the HMM-S in case of 10K, 20K 

223



 

and 40K training data. As the improvement due 
to MA decreases with increasing data, it might 
be concluded that the use of morphological re-
striction may not improve the accuracy when a 
large amount of training data is available. From 
our empirical observations we found that both 
suffix and morphological restriction (HMM-
S+suf+MA) gives an improvement of 27%, 17% 
and 12% over the HMM-S model respectively 
for the three different sizes of training data. 
 
The Maximum Entropy model does better than 
the HMM models for smaller training data. But 
with higher amount of training data the perform-
ance of the HMM and ME model are compara-
ble. Here also we observe that suffix information 
and MA have positive effect, and the effect is 
higher with poor resources.  
 
Furthermore, in order to estimate the relative per-
formance of the models, experiments were car-
ried out with two existing taggers: TnT (Brants, 
2000) and ACOPOST3. The accuracy achieved 
using TnT are 87.44% and 87.36% respectively 
with bigram and trigram model for 40K training 
data. The accuracy with ACOPOST is 86.3%.  
This reflects that the higher order Markov mod-
els do not work well under the current experi-
mental setup.  

3.5 Assessment of Error Types 
Table 2 shows the top five confusion classes for 
HMM-S+MA model. The most common types of 
errors are the confusion between proper noun 
and common noun and the confusion between 
adjective and common noun. This results from 
the fact that most of the proper nouns can be 
used as common nouns and most of the adjec-
tives can be used as common nouns in Bengali.

4 Conclusion 

In this paper we have described an approach for 
automatic stochastic tagging of natural language 
text for Bengali. The models described here are 
very simple and efficient for automatic tagging 
even when the amount of available annotated 
text is small. The models have a much higher 
accuracy than the naïve baseline model. How-
ever, the performance of the current system is 
not as good as that of the contemporary POS-
taggers available for English and other European 
languages. The best performance is achieved for 
the supervised learning model along with suffix 
information and morphological restriction on the 
possible grammatical categories of a word. In 
fact, the use of MA in any of the models dis-
cussed above enhances the performance of the 
POS tagger significantly. We conclude that the 
use of morphological features is especially help-
ful to develop a reasonable POS tagger when 
tagged resources are limited.
