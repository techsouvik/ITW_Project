Abstract

The paper proposes a methodology for deal-

ing with multiword expressions in natu-

ral language processing applications. It

provides a practically justified taxonomy

of such units, and suggests the ways in

which the individual classes can be pro-

cessed computationally. While the study is

currently limited to Polish and English, we

believe our findings can be successfully em-

ployed in the processing of other languages,

with emphasis on inflectional ones.

1 Introduction

radosław moszczyńskiIt is generally acknowledged

that multiword expressions constitute a serious diffi-

culty in all kinds of natural language processing ap-

plications (Sag et al., 2002). It has also been shown

that proper handling of such expressions can result

in significantly better results in parsing (Zhang et

al., 2006).

The difficulties in processing multiword expres-

sions result from their lexical variability, and the

fact that many of them can undergo syntactic trans-

formations. Another problem is that the label “mul-

tiword expressions” covers many linguistic units

that often have little in common. We believe that

the past approaches to formalize the phenomenon,

such as IDAREX (Segond and Breidt, 1995) and

Phrase Manager (Pedrazzini, 1994), suffered from

trying to cover all multiword expressions as a

whole. Such an approach, as is shown below, can-

not efficiently cover all the phenomena related to

multiword expressions.

Therefore, in the present paper we formulate a

proposal of a taxonomy for multiword expressions,

useful for the purposes of natural language process-

ing. The taxonomy is based on the stages in the

NLP workflow in which the individual classes of

units can be processed successfully. We also sug-

gest the tools that can be used for processing the

units in each of the classes.

2 An NLP Taxonomy of Multiword

Expressions

At this stage of work, our taxonomy is composed

of two groups of multiword expressions. The first

one consists of units that should be processed be-

fore syntactic analysis, and the other one includes

expressions whose recognition should be combined

with the syntactic analysis process. The next sec-

tions describe both groups in more detail.

2.1 Morphosyntactically Idiosyncratic

Expressions

The first group consists of morphosyntactically id-

iosyncratic units. They follow unusual morpholog-

ical and syntactic patterns, which causes difficulties

for automatic analyzers.

By morphological idiosyncrasies we mean two

types of units. First of all, there are bound words

that do not inflect and cannot be used independently

outside of the given multiword expression. In Pol-

ish, there are many such units, which are typically

prepositional phrases functioning as complex adver-

bials, e.g.:1

1
The asterisk in this and the following examples indicates

an untranslatable bound word.

19



(1) na

on

wskroś

*

‘thoroughly’

Secondly, there are unusual forms of otherwise

ordinary words that only appear in strictly defined

multiword expressions. An example is the follow-

ing unit, in which the genitive form of the noun

‘daddy’ is different than the one used outside this

particular construction:

(2) nie

Neg

rób

do-Imperative

z

of

tata

*daddy-Gen

wariata

fool

‘stop making a fool of me’

Morphological idiosyncrasies can be referred to

as “objective” in the sense that it can be proved by

doing corpus research that particular words only ap-

pear in a strictly limited set of constructions. Since

outside such constructions the words do not have

any meaning of their own, it is pointless to put them

in the lexicon of a morphological analyzer. From

the processing point of view, they are parts of com-

plex multiword lexemes which should be considered

as indivisible wholes.

Syntactically idiosyncratic phrases are those

whose structure or behavior is incorrect from the

point of view of a given grammar. In this sense,

they are “subjective”, because they depend on the

rules underlying a particular parser.

A typical parser of Polish is expected to accept

full sentences, i.e. phrases that contain a finite verb

phrase, but possibly not many phraseologisms that

are extremely common in texts and speech, and do

not constitute proper sentences from the point of

view of the grammar. This qualifies such phrases

to be included and formalized among the first group

we have distinguished. In Polish, such phrases in-

clude, e.g.:

(3) Precz

off

z

with

łapami!

hands-Inst

‘Get your hands off!’

Another group of multiword expressions that

should be processed before parsing consists of com-

plex adverbials that do not include any bound

words, but that could be interpreted wrongly by the

syntactic analyzer. Consider the following multi-

word expression:

(4) na

on

kolanach

knees-Loc

‘on one’s knees’ (‘groveling’)

This expression can be used in constructions of the

following type:

(5) Na

on

kolanach

knees-Loc

Kowalskiego

Kowalski-Gen

będą

be-Future;Pl;3rd

błagać.

beg-Infinitive

‘They will beg Kowalski on their knees.’

In the above example na kolanach is an adjunct

that is not subcategorized for by any of the remain-

ing constituents. However, since Kowalskiego is

genitive, the parser would be fooled to believe that

one of the possible interpretations is ‘They will beg

on Kowalski’s knees’, which is not correct and se-

mantically odd. Such complex adverbials are very

common in Polish, which is why we believe that for-

malizing them as wholes would allow us to achieve

better parsing results.

The last type of units that it is necessary to for-

malize for syntactic analysis are multiword text co-

hesion devices and interjections, whose syntactic

structure is hard to establish, as their constituents

belong to weakly defined classes. They can also

directly violate the grammar rules, as the coordina-

tion in the English example does:

(6) bądź

be-Imperative;Sg

co

what

bądź

be-Imperative;Sg

‘after all’

(7) by and large

Since the recognition and tagging of all the above

units will be performed before syntactic analysis, it

seems natural to combine this process with a gener-

alized mechanism of named entity recognition. We

intend to build a preprocessor for syntactic analy-

sis, along the lines of the ideas presented by Sagot

and Boullier (2005). However, in addition to the

set of named entities presented by the authors, we

also intend to formalize multiword expressions of

20



the types presented above, possibly with the use of

lxtransduce.2 This will allow us to prepare the

input to the parser in such a way as to eliminate all

the unparsable elements. This in turn should result

in significantly better parsing coverage.

2.2 Semantically Idiosyncratic Expressions

The other group in our classification consists of

multiword expressions that are idiosyncratic from

the point of view of semantics. It includes such

units as:

(8) NP-Nom

NP-Nom

wziąć

to take

nogi

legs-Acc

za

under

pas

belt-Acc

‘to run away’

From the syntactic analysis point of view, such

units are not problematic, as they follow regu-

lar grammatical patterns. They create difficulties

in other types of NLP-based applications, as their

meaning is not compositional, and cannot be pre-

dicted from the meaning of their constituents. Ex-

amples of such applications include electronic dic-

tionaries, which should be able to recognize idioms

and provide an appropriate, non-literal translation

(Prószéky and Földes, 2005).

Such expressions can be extremely complex due

to the lexical and word order variations they can

undergo, which is especially the case in such lan-

guages as Polish. The set of syntactic variations

that are possible in unit (8) is very large. First of

all, there is the subject (NP-Nom). English multi-

word expressions are usually encoded disregarding

the subject, as it can never break the continuity of

the other constituents. In Polish it is different —

the subject can be absent altogether, it can appear

at the very beginning of the multiword expression

without breaking its continuity, but it can also ap-

pear after the verb, between the core constituents.

The subject can be of arbitrary length and needs to

agree in morphosyntactic features (number, gender,

and person) with the verb.

The verb can be modified with adverbial phrases,

both on the left hand side and the right hand side.

2http://www.cogsci.ed.ac.uk/~richard/ltxml2/
lxtransduce.html

However, if the subject is postponed to a position

after the verb, all the potential right hand side ad-

verbials need to be attached after the subject, and

not directly after the verb. Thus, taking all the vari-

ation possibilities into account, it is not unlikely to

encounter such phrases in Polish:

(9) Wziął

take-1sg;Masc;Past

pan

you-1sg;Masc;Nom

przed

before

wszystkimi

everyone

nogi

legs-Acc

za

under

pas!

belt-Acc

‘You ran away before everyone else!’

Some of the English multiword expressions also

display properties that make them difficult to pro-

cess automatically. Although the word order is

more rigid, it is still necessary to handle, e.g., pas-

sivization and nominalization. This concerns the

canonical example of spill the beans, and many oth-

ers.

It follows that the units in the second group

should not, and probably cannot, be reliably en-

coded with the same means as the simpler units

from Section 2.1, which can be accounted for prop-

erly with simple methods based on regular gram-

mars and surface processing.

One possible solution is to encode the complex

units with the rules of a formal grammar of the

given language. Another solution could be con-

structing an appropriate valence dictionary for verbs

in such expressions. Both possibilities imply that

the recognition process should be performed simul-

taneously with syntactic analysis.

3 Rationale

The above classification was formulated during an

examination of the available formalisms for encod-

ing multiword expressions, which was a part of the

present work.

The attempts to formalize multiword expressions

for natural language processing can be roughly di-

vided into two groups. There are approaches that

aim at encoding such units with the rules of an

existing formal grammar, such as the approach de-

scribed by Debusmann (2004). On the other hand,

specialized, limited formalisms have been created,

21



whose purpose is to encode only multiword expres-

sions. Such formalisms include the already men-

tioned IDAREX (Segond and Breidt, 1995) and

Phrase Manager (Pedrazzini, 1994).

The first approach has two drawbacks. One of

them is that using the rules of a given grammar to

encode multiword expressions seems to have sense

only if the rest of the language is formalized in the

same way. Thus, such an approach makes the lexi-

con of multiword expressions heavily dependant on

a particular grammar, which might make its reuse

difficult or impossible.

The other disadvantage concerns complexity.

While full-blown grammars do have the means to

handle the most complex multiword expressions

and their transformational potential, they create too

much overhead in the case of simple units, such

as idiomatic prepositional phrases that function as

adverbials, which have been presented above.

Thus, we decided to encode Polish multiword ex-

pressions with an existing, specialized formalism.

However, after an evaluation of such formalisms

none of the ones we were able to find proved to

be adequate for Polish. This is mostly due to the

properties of the language — Polish is highly in-

flectional and has a relatively free word order. Both

of these properties also apply to multiword expres-

sions, which implies that in order to capture all their

possible variations in Polish, it is necessary to use

a powerful formalism (cf. the example in (9)).

Our analysis revealed that IDAREX, which is a

simple formalism based on regular grammars, is

not appropriate for handling expressions that have a

very variable word order and allow many modifica-

tions. In IDAREX, each multiword unit is encoded

with a regular expression, whose symbols are words

or POS-markers. The words are described in terms

of two-level morphology, and can appear either on

the lexical level (which permits inflection) or the

surface level (which restricts the word to the form

present in the regular expression). An example is

provided below:

(10) kick: :the :bucket;

Encoding the multiword expression in (8) with

IDAREX in such a way as to include all the pos-

sible variations leads to a description that suffers

from overgeneration. Also, IDAREX does not in-

clude any unification mechanisms. This makes it

unsuitable for any generation purposes (and reli-

able recognition purposes, too), as Polish requires

a means to enforce agreement between constituents.

Phrase Manager makes encoding multiword ex-

pressions difficult for other reasons. The method-

ology employed in the formalism requires each ex-

pression to be assigned to a predefined syntactic

class which determines the unit’s constituents, as

well as the modifications and transformations that

it can undergo:3

(11) SYNTAX-TREE

(VP V (NP Art Adj N AdvP))

MODIFICATIONS

V >

TRANSFORMATIONS

Passive, N-Adj-inversion

Since it is sometimes the case that multiword

expressions belonging to the same class differ in

respect of the syntactic operations they can undergo,

the classes are arranged into a tree-like structure in

which a class might be subdivided further on into a

subclass that allows passivization, another one that

allows nominalization and subject-verb inversion,

etc.

The problem with this approach is that it leads

to a proliferation of classes. At least in Polish,

multiword expressions that follow the same general

syntactic pattern often differ in the transformations

they allow. Besides, the formalism creates too much

overhead in the case of simple multiword expres-

sions. Consider the following example in Polish:

(12) No

oh

nie!

no

‘Oh, come on!’

In Phrase Manager it would be necessary to define

a syntactic class for this unit, which seems to be

both superfluous and problematic, as it is hard to

establish what parts of speech are the constituents

without taking purely arbitrary decisions.

To complicate matters further, the expression in

the example has a variant in which both constituents

elsewhere. The whole description is abbreviated.

22



switch their positions (with the meaning preserved).

In the case of such a simple expression, it is impos-

sible to “name” this transformation and assign any

syntactic or semantic prominence to it — it can

safely be treated as a simple permutation. How-

ever, Phrase Manager requires each operation to

be named and precisely defined in syntactic terms,

which in this case is more than it is worth.

In our opinion both those formalisms are in-

adequate for encoding all the phenomena labeled

as “multiword expressions”, especially in inflec-

tional languages. Such approaches might be suc-

cessful to a large extent in the case of fixed order

languages, such as English — both IDAREX and

Phrase Manager are reported to have been success-

fully employed for such purposes (Breidt and Feld-

weg, 1997; Tschichold, 2000). However, they fail

with languages that have richer inflection and per-

mit more word order variations. When used for

Polish, the surface processing oriented IDAREX

reaches the limits of its expressiveness; Phrase

Manager is inadequate for different reasons — the

assumptions it is based on would require something

not far from writing a complete grammar of Polish,

a task to which it is not suitable due to its limita-

tions. And on the other hand, it is much too com-

plicated for simple multiword expressions, such as

(12).

4 Previous Classifications

There are numerous classifications available in lin-

guistic literature, and we considered three of them

in turn. From the practical point of view, none of

them proved to be adequate for our needs. More

precisely, none of them partitioned the field of

multiword expressions into manageable classes that

could be handled individually by uniform mecha-

nisms.

The classification presented by Brundage et al.

(1992) approaches the whole problem from an an-

gle similar to what is required in Phrase Manager.

It is based on a study of ca. 300 English and Ger-

man multiword expressions, which were divided

into classes based on their syntactic constituency

and the transformations they are able to undergo.

Such an approach seems to be a dead end for

exactly the same reasons that Phrase Manager has

been criticized above. The study was limited to 300

units, which made the whole undertaking manage-

able. We believe that a really extensive study would

lead to an unpredictable proliferation of very similar

classes, which would make the whole classification

too fine-grained and unpractical for any processing

purposes.

The categorization that has been examined next

is the one presented by Sag et al. (2002). It con-

sists of three categories: fixed expressions (abso-

lutely immutable), semi-fixed expressions (strictly

fixed word order, but some lexical variation is al-

lowed), syntactically-flexible expressions (mainly

decomposable idioms — cf. (8)), and institution-

alized phrases (statistical idiosyncrasies). Unfortu-

nately, such a categorization is hard to use in the

case of some Polish multiword expressions. Con-

sider this example:

(13) Niech

let

to

it-Acc

szlag

*

trafi!

hit-Future

‘Damn it!’

It is hard to establish which of the above categories

does it belong to. The only lexically variable el-

ement is it, which can be substituted with another

noun. This would qualify the expression to be in-

cluded in the second category. However, it has a

very free word order (Niech to trafi szlag!, Szlag

niech to trafi!, and Niech trafi to szlag! are all

acceptable). This in turn qualifies it to the third

category, but it is not a decomposable idiom, and

the word order variations are not semantically jus-

tified transformations, but rather permutations, as

in (12). To make matters worse, the main element

— szlag — is a word with a very limited distribu-

tion. This intuitively makes the unit fit more into

the first category of unproductive expressions. This

is even more obvious considering the fact that the

word order variations do not change the meaning.

Another classification was presented by Guenth-

ner and Blanco (2004). Their categories are very

numerous, and the whole undertaking suffers from

the fact that they are not formally defined. It also

lacks a coherent purpose – it is neither a linguistic,

nor a natural language processing classification, as

it tries to put very different phenomena into one

bag.

23



The categories are sometimes more lexicograph-

ically, and sometimes more syntactically oriented.

For example, on the one hand the authors distin-

guish compound expressions (nouns, adverbs, etc.),

and on the other hand collocations. In our opinion

the categories should not be considered as parts of

the same classification, as members of the former

category belong to the lexicon, and the latter are

a purely distributional phenomenon. Therefore, in

the present form, the classification has no practical

use.

5 Conclusions and Further Work

We have shown that trying to provide a formal de-

scription of all phenomena labeled as multiword ex-

pressions as a whole is not possible, which becomes

obvious if one goes beyond English and tries to de-

scribe multiword expressions in heavily inflectional

and relatively free word order languages, such as

Polish. We have also shown the inadequacy of the

available classifications of multiword expressions

for computational processing of such languages.

In our opinion, a successful computational de-

scription of multiword expressions requires distin-

guishing two groups of units: idiosyncratic from

the point of view of morphosyntax and idiosyn-

cratic from the point of view of semantics. Such

a division allows for efficient use of existing tools

without the need of creating a cumbersome formal-

ism.

We believe that the practically oriented classifi-

cation presented above will allow us to build robust

tools for handling both types of multiword expres-

sions, which is the aim of our further research. The

immediate task is to build the syntactic preproces-

sor. We also plan to extend the classification to

make it slightly more fine-grained, which hopefully

will make even more efficient processing possible.
