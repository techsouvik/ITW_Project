Abstract 

I propose a computational treatment of su-
perlatives, starting with superlative con-
structions and the main challenges in 
automatically recognising and extracting 
their components. Initial experimental evi-
dence is provided for the value of the pro-
posed work for Question Answering. I also 
briefly discuss its potential value for Sen-
timent Detection and Opinion Extraction. 

1 Introduction 

Although superlatives are frequently found in 
natural language, with the exception of recent work 
by Bos and Nissim (2006) and Jindal and Liu 
(2006), they have not yet been investigated within 
a computational framework. And within the 
framework of theoretical linguistics, studies of su-
perlatives have mainly focused on particular se-
mantic properties that may only rarely occur in 
natural language (Szabolcsi, 1986; Heim, 1999). 

My goal is a comprehensive computational 
treatment of superlatives. The initial question I ad-
dress is how useful information can be automati-
cally extracted from superlative constructions. Due 
to the great semantic complexity and the variety of 
syntactic structures in which superlatives occur, 
this is a major challenge. However, meeting it will 
benefit NLP applications such as Question An-
swering, Sentiment Detection and Opinion Extrac-
tion, and Ontology Learning. 

2 What are Superlatives? 

In linguistics, the term “superlative” describes a 
well-defined class of word forms which (in Eng-

lish) are derived from adjectives or adverbs in two 
different ways: Inflectionally, where the suffix -est 
is appended to the base form of the adjective or 
adverb (e.g. lowest, nicest, smartest), or analyti-
cally, where the base adjective/adverb is preceded 
by the markers most/least (e.g. most interesting, 
least beautiful). Certain adjectives and adverbs 
have irregular superlative forms: good (best), bad 
(worst), far (furthest/farthest), well (best), badly 
(worst), much (most), and little (least).  

In order to be able to form superlatives, adjec-
tives and adverbs must be gradable, which means 
that it must be possible to place them on a scale of 
comparison, at a position higher or lower than the 
one indicated by the adjective/adverb alone. In 
English, this can be done by using the comparative 
and superlative forms of the adjective or adverb:  

[1] (a) Maths is more difficult than Physics. 
      (b) Chemistry is less difficult than Physics.  
[2] (a) Maths is the most difficult subject at school. 
      (b) History is the least difficult subject at school.  

The comparative form of an adjective or adverb is 
commonly used to compare two entities to one an-
other with respect to a certain quality. For exam-
ple, in [1], Maths is located at a higher point on the 
difficulty scale than Physics, and Chemistry at a 
lower point. The superlative form of an adjective 
is usually used to compare one entity to a set of 
other entities, and expresses the end spectrum of 
the scale: In [2], Maths and History are located at 
the highest and lowest points of the difficulty 
scale, respectively, while all the other subjects at 
school range somewhere in between. 

3 Why are Superlatives Interesting? 

From a computational perspective, superlatives 
are of interest because they express a comparison 

67



between a target entity (indicated in bold) and its 
comparison set (underlined), as in: 

[3] The blue whale is the largest mammal. 

Here, the target blue whale is compared to the 
comparison set of mammals. Milosavljevic (1999) 
has investigated the discourse purpose of different 
types of comparisons. She classifies superlatives as 
a type of set complement comparison, whose pur-
pose is to highlight the uniqueness of the target 
entity compared to its contrast set. 

My initial investigation of superlative forms 
showed that there are two types of relation that 
hold between a target and its comparison set: 

Relation 1: Superlative relation 
Relation 2: IS-A relation 

The superlative relation specifies a property which 
all members of the set share, but which the target 
has the highest (or lowest) degree or value of. The 
IS-A (or hypernymy) relation expresses the mem-
bership of the target in the comparison class (e.g. 
its parent class in a generalisation hierarchy). Both 
of these relations are of great interest from a rela-
tion extraction point of view, and in Section 6, I 
discuss their use in applications such as Question 
Answering (QA) and Sentiment Detection and 
Opinion Extraction. That a computational treat-
ment of superlatives is a worthwhile undertaking is 
also supported by the frequency of superlative 
forms in ordinary text: In a 250,000 word subcor-
pus of the WSJ corpus 1  I found 602 instances 
(which amounts to roughly one superlative form in 
every 17 sentences), while in the corpus of animal 
encyclopaedia entries used by Milosavljevic 
(1999), there were 1059 superlative forms in 
250,000 words (about one superlative form in 
every 11 sentences).2 These results show signifi-
cant variation in the distribution of superlatives 
across different text genres. 

4 Elements of a Computational Treat-
ment of Superlatives 

For an interpretation of comparisons, two things 
are generally of interest: What is being compared, 
and with respect to what this comparison is made. 
Given that superlatives express set comparisons, a 

                                                 
1 www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/LDC2000T43.html 
2 In the following, these 250,000 word subcorpora will 
be referred to as SubWSJ and SubAC. 

computational treatment should therefore help to 
identify: 

a) The target and comparison set 
b) The type of superlative relation that holds be-

tween them (cf. Relation 1 in Section 3)  

However, this task is far from straightforward, 
firstly because superlatives occur in a variety of 
different constructions. Consider for example: 

[4] The pipe organ is the largest instrument.     
[5] Of all the musicians in the brass band, Peter plays 

the largest instrument. 
[6] The human foot is narrowest at the heel. 
[7] First Class mail usually arrives the fastest. 
[8] This year, Jodie Foster was voted best actress. 
[9] I will get there at 8 at the earliest. 
[10] I am most tired of your constant moaning. 
[11] Most successful bands are from the U.S. 

All these examples contain a superlative form 
(bold italics). However, they differ not only in their 
syntactic structure, but also in the way in which 
they express a comparison. Example [4] contains a 
clear-cut comparison between a target item and its 
comparison set: The pipe organ is compared to all 
other instruments with respect to its size. However, 
although the superlative form in [4] occurs in the 
same noun phrase as in [5], the comparisons differ: 
What is being compared in [5] is not just the in-
struments, but the musicians in the brass band with 
respect to the size of the instrument that they play. 
In example [6], the target and comparison set are 
even less easy to identify. What is being compared 
here is not the human foot and a set of other enti-
ties, but rather different parts of the human foot. In 
contrast to the first two examples, this superlative 
form is not incorporated in a noun phrase, but oc-
curs freely in the sentence. The same applies to 
fastest in example [7], which is an adverbial super-
lative. The comparison here is between First Class 
mail and other mail delivery services. Finally, ex-
amples [8] to [11] are not proper comparisons: best 
actress in [8] is an idiomatic expression, earliest in 
[9] is part of a so-called PP superlative construc-
tion (Corver and Matushansky, 2006), and [10] and 
[11] describe two non-comparative uses of most, as 
an intensifier and a proportional quantifier, respec-
tively (Huddleston and Pullum, 2002). 

Initially, I will focus on cases like [4], which I 
call IS-A superlatives because they make explicit 
the IS-A relation that holds between target and 
comparison set (cf. Relation 2 in Section 3). They 

68



are a good initial focus for a computational ap-
proach because both their target and comparison 
set are explicitly realised in the text (usually, 
though not necessarily, in the same sentence). 
Common surface forms of IS-A superlatives in-
volve the verb “to be” ([12]-[14]), appositive posi-
tion [15], and other copula verbs or expressions 
([16] and [17]): 

[12] The blue whale is the largest mammal. 
[13] The blue whale is the largest of all mammals. 
[14] Of all mammals, the blue whale is the largest. 
[15] The largest mammal, the blue whale, weighs... 
[16] The ostrich is considered the largest bird. 
[17] Mexico claimed to be the most peaceful country 

in the Americas. 

IS-A superlatives are also the most frequent type of 
superlative comparison, with 176 instances in 
SubWSJ (ca. 30% of all superlative forms), and 
350 instances in SubAC (ca. 33% of all superlative 
forms).  

The second major problem in a computational 
treatment of superlatives is to correctly identify 
and interpret the comparison set. The challenge lies 
in the fact that it can be restricted in a variety of 
ways, for example by preceding possessives and 
premodifiers, or by postmodifiers such as PPs and 
various kinds of clauses. Consider for example: 

[18] VW is [Europe’s largest maker of cars]. 
[19] VW is [the largest European car maker with this 

product range]. 
[20] VW is [the largest car maker in Europe] with an 

impressive product range. 
[21] In China, VW is by far [the largest car maker]. 

The phrases of cars and car in [18] and [19] 
both have the role of specifying the type of maker 
that constitutes the comparison set. The phrases 
Europe’s, European and in Europe occur in deter-
minative, premodifying, and postmodifying posi-
tion, respectively, but all have the role of restrict-
ing the set of car makers to the ones in Europe. 
And finally, the “with” PP phrases in [19] and [20] 
both occur in postmodifying position, but differ in 
that the one in [19] is involved in the comparison, 
while the one in [20] is non-restrictive. In addition, 
restrictors of the comparison can also occur else-
where in the sentence, as shown by the PP phrase 
and adverbial in [21]. It is evident that in order to 
extract useful and reliable information, a thorough 
syntactic and semantic analysis of superlative con-
structions is required. 

5 Previous Approaches 

5.1 Jindal and Liu (2006) 

Jindal and Liu (2006) propose the study of com-
parative sentence mining, by which they mean the 
study of sentences that express “an ordering 
relation between two sets of entities with respect to 
some common features” (2006). They consider 
three kinds of relations: non-equal gradable (e.g. 
better), equative (e.g. as good as) and superlative 
(e.g. best). Having identified comparative sen-
tences in a given text, the task is to extract com-
parative relations from them, in form of a vector 
like (relationWord, features, entityS1, entityS2), 
where relationWord represents the keyword used 
to express a comparative relation, features are a set 
of features being compared, and entityS1 and enti-
tyS2 are the sets of entities being compared, where 
entityS1 appears to the left of the relation word and 
entityS2 to the right. Thus, for a sentence like 
“Canon’s optics is better than those of Sony and 
Nikon”, the system is expected to extract the vector 
(better, {optics}, {Canon}, {Sony, Nikon}). 

For extracting the comparative relations, Jindal 
and Liu use what they call label sequential rules 
(LSR), mainly based on POS tags. Their overall F-
score for this extraction task is 72%, a big im-
provement to the 58% achieved by their baseline 
system. Although this result suggests that their sys-
tem represents a powerful way of dealing with su-
perlatives computationally, a closer inspection of 
their approach, and in particular of the gold stan-
dard data set, reveals some serious problems.  

Jindal and Liu claim that for superlatives, the 
entityS2 slot is “normally empty” (2006). Assum-
ing that the members of entityS2 usually represent 
the comparison set, this is somewhat counter-
intuitive. A look at the data shows that even in 
cases where the comparison set is explicitly men-
tioned in the sentence, the entityS2 slot remains 
empty. For example, although the comparison set 
in [22] is represented by the string these 2nd gen-
eration jukeboxes ( ipod , archos , dell , samsung ), 
it is not annotated as entityS2 in the gold standard: 

[22] all reviews i 've seen seem to in-
dicate that the creative mp3 jukeboxes 
have the best sound quality of these 
2nd generation jukeboxes ( ipod , ar-
chos , dell , samsung ) .  

(best, {sound quality}, {creative mp3 jukeboxes}, {--}) 

Jindal and Liu (2006)

Furthermore, Jindal and Liu do not distinguish 
between different types of superlatives. In con-
structions where the superlative form is incorpo-
rated into an NP, Jindal and Liu consistently inter-
pret the string following the superlative form as a 
“feature”, which is appropriate for cases like [22], 
but does not apply to superlative sentences involv-
ing the copula verb “to be” (as e.g. in [4]), where 
the NP head denotes the comparison set rather than 
a feature. A further major problem is that restric-
tions on the comparison set as the ones discussed 
in Section 4 and negation are not considered at all. 
Therefore, the reliability of the output produced by 
the system is questionable. 

5.2 Bos and Nissim (2006) 

In contrast to Jindal and Liu (2006), Bos and 
Nissim’s (2006) approach to superlatives is explic-
itly semantic. They describe an implementation of 
a system that can automatically detect superlatives, 
and determine the correct comparison set for at-
tributive cases, where the superlative form is in-
corporated into an NP. For example in [23], the 
comparison set of the superlative oldest spans from 
word 3 to word 7: 

[23]  wsj00 1690 [...] Scope: 3-7 
The oldest bell-ringing group in the 
country , the Ancient Society of Col-
lege Youths , founded in 1637 , re-
mains male-only , [...] .  

(Bos and Nissim 2006) 

Bos and Nissim’s system, called DLA (Deep Lin-
guistic Analysis), uses a wide-coverage parser to 
produce semantic representations of superlative 
sentences, which are then exploited to select the 
comparison set among attributive cases. Compared 
with a baseline result, the results for this are very 
good, with an accuracy of 69%-83%. 

The results are clearly very promising and show 
that comparison sets can be identified with high 
accuracy. However, this only represents a first step 
towards the goal of the present work. Apart from 
the superlative keyword oldest, the only informa-
tion example [23] provides is that the comparison 
set spans from word 3 to word 7. However, what 
would be interesting to know is that the target of 
the comparison appears in the same sentence and 
spans from word 9 to word 14 (the Ancient Society 
of College Youths). Furthermore, no analysis of the 
semantic roles of the constituents of the resulting 
string is carried out: We lose the information that 

the Ancient Society of College Youths IS-A kind of 
bell-ringing group, and that the set of bell-ringing 
groups is restricted in location (in the country). 

6 Applications 

The proposed work will be beneficial for a vari-
ety of areas in NLP, for example Question An-
swering (QA), Sentiment Detection/Opinion Ex-
traction, Ontology Learning, or Natural Language 
Generation. In this section I will discuss applica-
tions in the first two areas. 

6.1 Question Answering 

In open-domain QA, the proposed work will be 
useful for answering two question types. A super-
lative sentence like [24], found in a corpus, can be 
used to answer both a factoid question [25] and a 
definition question [26]:  

[24] A: The Nile is the longest river in the world. 
[25] Q: What is the world’s longest river?  
[26] Q: What is the Nile? 

Here I will focus on the latter. The common as-
sumption that superlatives are useful with respect 
to answering definition questions is based on the 
observation that superlatives like the one in [24] 
both place an entity in a generalisation hierarchy, 
and distinguish it from its contrast set. 

To investigate this assumption, I carried out a 
study involving the TREC QA “other” question 
nuggets3, which are snippets of text that contain 
relevant information for the definition of a specific 
topic. In a recent study of judgement consistency 
(Lin and Demner-Fushman, 2006), relevant nug-
gets were judged as either 'vital' or 'okay' by 10 
different judges rather than the single assessor 
standardly used in TREC. For example, the first 
three nuggets for the topic “Merck & Co.” are: 

[27] Qid 75.8: 'other' question for target Merck & Co. 
75.8  1   vital   World's largest drug company. 
75.8  2   okay   Spent $1.68 billion on RandD in 

1997. 
75.8  3   okay   Has experience finding new uses 

for established drugs. 

(taken from TREC 2005; 'vital' and 'okay' reflect 
the opinion of the TREC evaluator.) 

My investigation of the nugget judgements in 
Lin and Demner-Fushman's study yielded two in-

teresting results: First of all, a relatively high pro-
portion of relevant nuggets contains superlatives: 
On average, there is one superlative nugget for at 
least half of the TREC topics. Secondly, of 69 
superlative nuggets altogether, 32 (i.e. almost half) 
are judged “vital” by more than 9 assessors.  

Furthermore, I found that the nuggets can be dis-
tinguished by how the question target (i.e. the 
TREC topic, referred to as T1) relates to the super-
lative target (T2): In the first case, T1 and T2 coin-
cide (referred to as class S1). In the second one, T2 
is part of or closely related to T1, or T2 is part of 
the comparison set (class S2). In the third case, T1 
is unrelated or only distantly related to T2 (S3). 
Table 1 shows examples of each class: 

 T1 nugget (T2 in bold) 
S1 Merck & Co. World's largest drug company 
S2 Florence 

Nightingale 
Nightingale Medal highest  
international nurses award 

S3 Kurds Irbil largest city controlled by 
Kurds 

Table 1. Examples of superlative nuggets. 

Of the 69 nuggets containing superlatives, 46 
fall into subclass S1, 15 into subclass S2 and 8 into 
subclass S3. While I noted earlier that 32/69 (46%) 
of superlative-containing nuggets were judged vital 
by more than 9 assessors, these judgements are not 
equally distributed over the subclasses: Table 2 
shows that 87% of S1 judgements are 'vital', while 
only 38% of S3 judgements are.

S2 15 59% 40% 
S3 8 38% 60% 

Table 2. Ratings of the classes S1, S2, and S3. 

These results strongly suggest that the presence 
of superlatives, and in particular S1 membership, is 
a good indicator of the importance of nuggets, and 
thus for answering definition questions. Some ex-
periments carried out in the framework of TREC 
2006 (Kaisser et al., 2006), however, showed that 
superlatives alone are not a winning indicator of 
nugget importance, but S1 membership may be. A 
similar simple technique was used by Ahn et al. 
(2005) and by Razmara and Kosseim (2007). All 
just looked for the presence of a superlative and 
raised the score without further analysing the type 
of superlative or its role in the sentence. This calls 

for a more sophisticated approach, where class S1 
superlatives can be distinguished. 

6.2 Sentiment Detection/Opinion Extraction 

Like adjectives and adverbs, superlatives can be 
objective or subjective. Compare for example: 

[28] The Black Forest is the largest forest in 
Germany.                [objective] 
[29] The Black Forest is the most beautiful area 
in Germany.               [subjective] 

So far, none of the studies in sentiment detection 
(e.g. Wilson et al., 2005; Pang et al., 2002) or opin-
ion extraction (e.g. Hu and Liu, 2004; Popescu and 
Etzioni, 2005) have specifically looked at the role 
of superlatives in these areas. 

Like subjective adjectives, subjective superla-
tives can either express positive or negative opin-
ions. This polarity depends strongly on the adjec-
tive or adverb that the superlative is derived from.4 
As superlatives place the adjective or adverb at the 
highest or lowest point of the comparison scale (cf. 
Section 2), the question of interest is how this af-
fects the polarity of the adjective/adverb. If the 
intensity of the polarity increases in a likewise 
manner, then subjective superlatives are bound to 
express the strongest or weakest opinions possible. 
If this hypothesis holds true, an “extreme opinion” 
extraction system could be created by combining 
the proposed superlative extraction system with a 
subjectivity recognition system that can identify 
subjective superlatives. This would clearly be of 
interest to many companies and market researchers. 

Initial searches in Hu and Liu’s annotated cor-
pus of customer reviews (2004) look promising. 
Sentences in this corpus are annotated with infor-
mation about positive and negative opinions, 
which are located on a six-point scale, where [+/-3] 
stand for the strongest positive/negative opinions, 
and [+/-1] stand for the weakest positive/negative 
opinions. A search for annotated sentences con-
taining superlatives shows that an overwhelming 
majority are marked with strongest opinion labels. 

7 Summary and Future Work 

This paper proposed the task of automatically ex-
tracting useful information from superlatives oc-

                                                 
4 It may, however, also depend on whether the superla-
tive expresses the highest ('most') or the lowest ('least') 
point in the scale.

curring in free text. It provided an overview of su-
perlative constructions and the main challenges 
that have to be faced, described previous computa-
tional approaches and their limitations, and dis-
cussed applications in two areas in NLP: QA and 
Sentiment Detection/Opinion Extraction.  

The proposed task can be seen as consisting of 
three subtasks:  

TASK 1: Decide whether a given sentence contains 
a superlative form  
TASK 2: Given a sentence containing a superlative 
form, identify what type of superlative it is (ini-
tially: IS-A superlative or not?) 
TASK 3: For set comparisons, identify the target 
and the comparison set, as well as the superlative 
relation 

Task 1 can be tackled by a simple approach rely-
ing on POS tags (e.g. JJS and RBS in the Penn 
Treebank tagset). For Task 2, I have carried out a 
thorough analysis of the different types of superla-
tive forms and postulated a new classification for 
them. My present efforts are on the creation of a 
gold standard data set for the extraction task. As 
superlatives are particularly frequent in encyclo-
paedic language (cf. Section 3), I am considering 
using the Wikipedia 5  as a knowledge base. The 
main challenge is to devise a suitable annotation 
scheme which can account for all syntactic struc-
tures in which IS-A superlatives occur and which 
incorporates their semantic properties in an ade-
quate way (semantic role labelling). Finally, for 
Task 3, I plan to use both manually created rules 
and machine learning techniques.
