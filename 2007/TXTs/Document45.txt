Abstract

We present a study aimed at investigating
the use of semantic information in a novel
NLP application, Electronic Career Guid-
ance (ECG), in German. ECG is formu-
lated as an information retrieval (IR) task,
whereby textual descriptions of professions
(documents) are ranked for their relevance
to natural language descriptions of a per-
son’s professional interests (the topic). We
compare the performance of two semantic
IR models: (IR-1) utilizing semantic relat-
edness (SR) measures based on either word-
net or Wikipedia and a set of heuristics,
and (IR-2) measuring the similarity between
the topic and documents based on Explicit
Semantic Analysis (ESA) (Gabrilovich and
Markovitch, 2007). We evaluate the perfor-
mance of SR measures intrinsically on the
tasks of (T-1) computing SR, and (T-2) solv-
ing Reader’s Digest Word Power (RDWP)
questions.

1 Electronic Career Guidance

Career guidance is important both for the person in-
volved and for the state. Not well informed deci-
sions may cause people to drop the training program
they are enrolled in, yielding loss of time and finan-
cial investments. However, there is a mismatch bet-
ween what people know about existing professions
and the variety of professions, which exist in real-
ity. Some studies report that school leavers typi-
cally choose the professions known to them, such

as policeman, nurse, etc. Many other professions,
which can possibly match the interests of the person
very well, are not chosen, as their titles are unknown
and people seeking career advice do not know about
their existence, e.g. electronics installer, or chem-
ical laboratory worker. However, people are very
good at describing their professional interests in nat-
ural language. That is why they are even asked to
write a short essay prior to an appointment with a
career guidance expert.

Electronic career guidance is, thus, a supplement
to career guidance by human experts, helping young
people to decide which profession to choose. The
goal is to automatically compute a ranked list of pro-
fessions according to the user’s interests. A current
system employed by the German Federal Labour
Office (GFLO) in their automatic career guidance
front-end1 is based on vocational trainings, manu-
ally annotated using a tagset of 41 keywords. The
user must select appropriate keywords according to
her interests. In reply, the system consults a knowl-
edge base with professions manually annotated with
the keywords by career guidance experts. There-
after, it outputs a list of the best matching profes-
sions to the user. This approach has two significant
disadvantages. Firstly, the knowledge base has to
be maintained and steadily updated, as the number
of professions and keywords associated with them
is continuously changing. Secondly, the user has to
describe her interests in a very restricted way.

At the same time, GFLO maintains an extensive
database with textual descriptions of professions,

1http://www.interesse-beruf.de/

called BERUFEnet.2 Therefore, we cast the prob-
lem of ECG as an IR task, trying to remove the
disadvantages of conventional ECG outlined above
by letting the user describe her interests in a short
natural language essay, called a professional profile.

Example essay translated to English
I would like to work with animals, to treat and look
after them, but I cannot stand the sight of blood and
take too much pity on them. On the other hand, I like
to work on the computer, can program in C, Python and
VB and so I could consider software development as an
appropriate profession. I cannot imagine working in a
kindergarden, as a social worker or as a teacher, as I
am not very good at asserting myself.

Textual descriptions of professions are ranked
given such an essay by using NLP and IR tech-
niques. As essays and descriptions of professions
display a mismatch between the vocabularies of top-
ics and documents and there is lack of contextual in-
formation, due to the documents being fairly short
as compared to standard IR scenarios, lexical se-
mantic information should be especially beneficial
to an IR system. For example, the profile can con-
tain words about some objects or activities related to
the profession, but not directly mentioned in the de-
scription, e.g. oven, cakes in the profile and pastries,
baker, or confectioner in the document. Therefore,
we propose to utilize semantic relatedness as a rank-
ing function instead of conventional IR techniques,
as will be substantiated below.

2 System Architecture

Integrating lexical semantic knowledge in ECG re-
quires the existence of knowledge bases encoding
domain and lexical knowledge. In this paper, we in-
vestigate the utility of two knowledge bases: (i) a
German wordnet, GermaNet (Kunze, 2004), and (ii)
the German portion of Wikipedia.3 A large body of
research exists on using wordnets in NLP applica-
tions and in particular in IR (Moldovan and Mihal-
cea, 2000). The knowledge in wordnets has been
typically utilized by expanding queries with related
terms (Vorhees, 1994; Smeaton et al., 1994), con-
cept indexing (Gonzalo et al., 1998), or similarity
measures as ranking functions (Smeaton et al., 1994;
Müller and Gurevych, 2006). Recently, Wikipedia

2http://infobub.arbeitsagentur.de/
berufe/

3http://de.wikipedia.org/

has been discovered as a promising lexical seman-
tic resource and successfully used in such different
NLP tasks as question answering (Ahn et al., 2004),
named entity disambiguation (Bunescu and Pasca,
2006), and information retrieval (Katz et al., 2005).
Further research (Zesch et al., 2007b) indicates that
German wordnet and Wikipedia show different per-
formance depending on the task at hand.

Departing from this, we first compare two seman-
tic relatedness (SR) measures based on the informa-
tion either in the German wordnet (Lin, 1998) called
LIN, or in Wikipedia (Gabrilovich and Markovitch,
2007) called Explicit Semantic Analysis, or ESA.
We evaluate their performance intrinsically on the
tasks of (T-1) computing semantic relatedness, and
(T-2) solving Reader’s Digest Word Power (RDWP)
questions and make conclusions about the ability of
the measures to model certain aspects of semantic
relatedness and their coverage. Furthermore, we fol-
low the approach by Müller and Gurevych (2006),
who proposed to utilize the LIN measure and a set
of heuristics as an IR model (IR-1).

Additionally, we utilize the ESA measure in a
semantic information retrieval model, as this mea-
sure is significantly better at vocabulary cover-
age and at modelling cross part-of-speech relations
(Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007). We compare
the performance of ESA and LIN measures in a task-
based IR evaluation and analyze their strengths and
limitations. Finally, we apply ESA to directly com-
pute text similarities between topics and documents
(IR-2) and compare the performance of two seman-
tic IR models and a baseline Extended Boolean (EB)
model (Salton et al., 1983) with query expansion.4

To summarize, the contributions of this paper are
three-fold: (i) we present a novel system, utilizing
NLP and IR techniques to perform Electronic Career
Guidance, (ii) we study the properties and intrinsi-
cally evaluate two SR measures based on GermaNet
and Wikipedia for the tasks of computing seman-
tic relatedness and solving Reader’s Digest Word
Power Game questions, and (iii) we investigate the
performance of two semantic IR models in a task
based evaluation.

4We also ran experiments with Okapi BM25 model as im-
plemented in the Terrier framework, but the results were worse
than those with the EB model. Therefore, we limit our discus-
sion to the latter.

3 Computing Semantic Relatedness

3.1 SR Measures

GermaNet based measures GermaNet is a Ger-
man wordnet, which adopted the major properties
and database technology from Princeton’s Word-
Net (Fellbaum, 1998). However, GermaNet dis-
plays some structural differences and content ori-
ented modifications. Its designers relied mainly on
linguistic evidence, such as corpus frequency, rather
than psycholinguistic motivations. Also, GermaNet
employs artificial, i.e. non-lexicalized concepts, and
adjectives are structured hierarchically as opposed
to WordNet. Currently, GermaNet includes about
40000 synsets with more than 60000 word senses
modelling nouns, verbs and adjectives.

We use the semantic relatedness measure by Lin
(1998) (referred to as LIN), as it consistently is
among the best performing wordnet based measures
(Gurevych and Niederlich, 2005; Budanitsky and
Hirst, 2006). Lin defined semantic similarity using a
formula derived from information theory. This mea-
sure is sometimes called a universal semantic sim-
ilarity measure as it is supposed to be application,
domain, and resource independent. Lin is computed
as:

simc1,c2 =
2 × log p(LCS(c1, c2))
log p(c1) + log p(c2)

where c1 and c2 are concepts (word senses) corre-
sponding to w1 and w2, log p(c) is the information
content, and LCS(c1, c2) is the lowest common sub-
sumer of the two concepts. The probability p is com-
puted as the relative frequency of words (represent-
ing that concept) in the taz5 corpus.

Wikipedia based measures Wikipedia is a free
online encyclopedia that is constructed in a col-
laborative effort of voluntary contributors and still
grows exponentially. During this process, Wikipedia
has probably become the largest collection of freely
available knowledge. Wikipedia shares many of
its properties with other well known lexical seman-
tic resources (like dictionaries, thesauri, semantic
wordnets or conventional encyclopedias) (Zesch et
al., 2007a). As Wikipedia also models relatedness
between concepts, it is better suited for computing

5http://www.taz.de

semantic relatedness than GermaNet (Zesch et al.,
2007b).

In very recent work, Gabrilovich and Markovitch
(2007) introduce a SR measure called Explicit Se-
mantic Analysis (ESA). The ESA measure repre-
sents the meaning of a term as a high-dimensional
concept vector. The concept vector is derived from
Wikipedia articles, as each article focuses on a cer-
tain topic, and can thus be viewed as expressing a
concept. The dimension of the concept vector is the
number of Wikipedia articles. Each element of the
vector is associated with a certain Wikipedia article
(or concept). If the term can be found in this article,
the term’s tfidf score (Salton and McGill, 1983) in
this article is assigned to the vector element. Oth-
erwise, 0 is assigned. As a result, a term’s con-
cept vector represents the importance of the term for
each concept. Semantic relatedness of two terms can
then be easily computed as the cosine of their corre-
sponding concept vectors. If we want to measure
the semantic relatedness of texts instead of terms,
we can also use ESA concept vectors. A text is rep-
resented as the average concept vector of its terms’
concept vectors. Then, the relatedness of two texts
is computed as the cosine of their average concept
vectors.

As ESA uses all textual information in Wikipedia,
the measure shows excellent coverage. Therefore,
we select it as the second measure for integration
into our IR system.

3.2 Datasets

Semantic relatedness datasets for German em-
ployed in our study are presented in Table 1.
Gurevych (2005) conducted experiments with two
datasets: i) a German translation of the English
dataset by Rubenstein and Goodenough (1965)
(Gur65), and ii) a larger dataset containing 350
word pairs (Gur350). Zesch and Gurevych (2006)
created a third dataset from domain-specific corpora
using a semi-automatic process (ZG222). Gur65 is
rather small and contains only noun-noun pairs con-
nected by either synonymy or hypernymy. Gur350
contains nouns, verbs and adjectives that are con-
nected by classical and non-classical relations (Mor-
ris and Hirst, 2004). However, word pairs for
this dataset are biased towards strong classical rela-
tions, as they were manually selected from a corpus.

Table 1: Comparison of datasets used for evaluating semantic relatedness in German.

ZG222 does not have this bias.
Following the work by Jarmasz and Szpakow-

icz (2003) and Turney (2006), we created a sec-
ond dataset containing multiple choice questions.
We collected 1072 multiple-choice word analogy
questions from the German Reader’s Digest Word
Power Game (RDWP) from January 2001 to De-
cember 2005 (Wallace and Wallace, 2005). We dis-
carded 44 questions that had more than one correct
answer, and 20 questions that used a phrase instead
of a single term as query. The resulting 1008 ques-
tions form our evaluation dataset. An example ques-
tion is given below:

Muffin (muffin)
a) Kleingebäck (small cake)

b) Spenglerwerkzeug (plumbing tool)

c) Miesepeter (killjoy)

d) Wildschaf (moufflon)

The task is to find the correct choice - ‘a)’ in this
case.

This dataset is significantly larger than any of the
previous datasets employed in this type of evalua-
tion. Also, it is not restricted to synonym questions,
as in the work by Jarmasz and Szpakowicz (2003),
but also includes hypernymy/hyponymy, and few
non-classical relations.

3.3 Analysis of Results
Table 2 gives the results of evaluation on the task
of correlating the results of an SR measure with hu-
man judgments using Pearson correlation. The Ger-
maNet based LIN measure outperforms ESA on the
Gur65 dataset. On the other datasets, ESA is better
than LIN. This is clearly due to the fact, that Gur65
contains only noun-noun word pairs connected by
classical semantic relations, while the other datasets
also contain cross part-of-speech pairs connected by
non-classical relations. The Wikipedia based ESA
measure can better capture such relations. Addition-
ally, Table 3 shows that ESA also covers almost all

word pairs in each dataset, while GermaNet is much
lower for Gur350 and ZG222. ESA performs even
better on the Reader’s Digest task (see Table 4). It
shows high coverage and near human performance
regarding the relative number of correctly solved
questions.6 Given the high performance and cover-
age of the Wikipedia based ESA measure, we expect
it to yield better IR results than LIN.

4 Information Retrieval

4.1 IR Models
Preprocessing For creating the search index for
IR models, we apply first tokenization and then re-
move stop words. We use a general German stop

they only indicate the approximate difficulty of the task. We
plan to use this dataset with a much larger group of subjects.

word list extended with highly frequent domain spe-
cific terms. Before adding the remaining words to
the index, they are lemmatized. We finally split
compounds into their constituents, and add both,
constituents and compounds, to the index.

EB model Lucene7 is an open source text search
library based on an EB model. After matching the
preprocessed queries against the index, the docu-
ment collection is divided into a set of relevant and
irrelevant documents. The set of relevant documents
is, then, ranked according to the formula given in the
following equation:

rEB(d, q) =
nq∑
i=1

tf(tq, d)·idf(tq)·lengthNorm(d)

where nq is the number of terms in the query,
tf(tq, d) is the term frequency factor for term tq
in document d, idf(tq) is the inverse document fre-
quency of the term, and lengthNorm(d) is a nor-
malization value of document d, given the number
of terms within the document. We added a simple
query expansion algorithm using (i) synonyms, and
(ii) hyponyms, extracted from GermaNet.

IR based on SR For the (IR-1) model, we uti-
lize two SR measures and a set of heuristics: (i)
the Lin measure based on GermaNet (LIN), and (ii)
the ESA measure based on Wikipedia (ESA-Word).
This algorithm was applied to the German IR bench-
mark with positive results by Müller and Gurevych
(2006). The algorithm computes a SR score for each
query and document term pair. Scores above a pre-
defined threshold are summed up and weighted by
different factors, which boost or lower the scores for
documents, depending on how many query terms are
contained exactly or contribute a high enough SR
score. In order to integrate the strengths of tradi-
tional IR models, the inverse document frequency
idf is considered, which measures the general im-
portance of a term for predicting the content of a
document. The final formula of the model is as fol-
lows:

rSR(d, q) =
∑nd

i=1

∑nq
j=1 idf(tq,j) · s(td,i, tq,j)

(1 + nnsm) · (1 + nnr)
7http://lucene.apache.org

where nd is the number of tokens in the document,
nq the number of tokens in the query, td,i the i-th
document token, tq,j the j-th query token, s(td,i, tq,j)
the SR score for the respective document and query
term, nnsm the number of query terms not exactly
contained in the document, nnr the number of query
tokens, which do not contribute a SR score above the
threshold.

For the (IR-2) model, we apply the ESA method
for directly comparing the query with documents, as
described in Section 3.1.

4.2 Data

The corpus employed in our experiments was built
based on a real-life IR scenario in the domain of
ECG, as described in Section 1. The document col-
lection is extracted from BERUFEnet,8 a database
created by the GFLO. It contains textual descrip-
tions of about 1,800 vocational trainings, and 4,000
descriptions of professions. We restrict the collec-
tion to a subset of BERUFEnet documents, consist-
ing of 529 descriptions of vocational trainings, due
to the process necessary to obtain relevance judg-
ments, as described below. The documents contain
not only details of professions, but also a lot of infor-
mation concerning the training and administrative
issues. We only use those portions of the descrip-
tions, which characterize the profession itself.

We collected real natural language topics by ask-
ing 30 human subjects to write an essay about their
professional interests. The topics contain 130 words,
on average. Making relevance judgments for ECG
requires domain expertise. Therefore, we applied an
automatic method, which uses the knowledge base
employed by the GFLO, described in Section 1. To
obtain relevance judgments, we first annotate each
essay with relevant keywords from the tagset of 41
and retrieve a ranked list of professions, which were
assigned one or more keywords by domain experts.
To map the ranked list to a set of relevant and ir-
relevant professions, we use a threshold of 3, as
suggested by career guidance experts. This setting
yields on average 93 relevant documents per topic.
The quality of the automatically created gold stan-
dard depends on the quality of the applied knowl-
edge base. As the knowledge base was created by

8http://berufenet.arbeitsamt.de/

1036



domain experts and is at the core of the electronic ca-
reer guidance system of the GFLO, we assume that
the quality is adequate to ensure a reliable evalua-
tion.

4.3 Analysis of Results
In Table 5, we summarize the results of the ex-
periments applying different IR models on the
BERUFEnet data. We build queries from natural
language essays by (QT-1) extracting nouns, verbs,
and adjectives, (QT-2) using only nouns, and (QT-
3) manually assigning suitable keywords from the
tagset with 41 keywords to each topic. We report the
results with two different thresholds (.85 and .98) for
the Lin model, and with three different thresholds
(.11, .13 and .24) for the ESA-Word models. The
evaluation metrics used are mean average precision
(MAP), precision after ten documents (P10), the
number of relevant returned documents (#RRD). We
compute the absolute value of Spearman’s rank cor-
relation coefficient (SRCC) by comparing the rele-
vance ranking of our system with the relevance rank-
ing of the knowledge base employed by the GFLO.

Using query expansion for the EB model de-
creases the retrieval performance for most configu-
rations. The SR based models outperform the EB
model in all configurations and evaluation metrics,
except for P10 on the keyword based queries. The
Lin model is always outperformed by at least one of
the ESA models, except for (QT-3). (IR-2) performs
best on longer queries using nouns, verbs, adjectives
or just nouns.

Comparing the number of relevant retrieved doc-
uments, we observe that the IR models based on SR
are able to return more relevant documents than the
EB model. This supports the claim that semantic
knowledge is especially helpful for the vocabulary
mismatch problem, which cannot be addressed by
conventional IR models. E.g., only SR-based mod-
els can find the job information technician for a pro-
file which contains the sentence My interests and
skills are in the field of languages and IT. The job
could only be judged as relevant, as the semantic
relation between IT in the profile and information
technology in the professional description could be
found.

In our analysis of the BERUFEnet results ob-
tained on (QT-1), we noticed that many errors were

due to the topics expressed in free natural language
essays. Some subjects deviated from the given task
to describe their professional interests and described
facts that are rather irrelevant to the task of ECG,
e.g. It is important to speak different languages in
the growing European Union. If all content words
are extracted to build a query, a lot of noise is intro-
duced.

Therefore, we conducted further experiments
with (QT-2) and (QT-3): building the query using
only nouns, and using manually assigned keywords
based on the tagset of 41 keywords. For example,
the following query is built for the professional pro-
file given in Section 1.
Keywords assigned:

care for/nurse/educate/teach; use/program computer;

office; outside: outside facilities/natural

environment; animals/plants

IR results obtained on (QT-2) and (QT-3) show
that the performance is better for nouns, and sig-
nificantly better for the queries built of keywords.
This suggests that in order to achieve high IR perfor-
mance for the task of Electronic Career Guidance,
it is necessary to preprocess the topics by perform-
ing information extraction to remove the noise from
free text essays. As a result of the preprocessing,
natural language essays should be mapped to a set
of keywords relevant for describing a person’s in-
terests. Our results suggest that the word-based se-
mantic relatedness IR model (IR-1) performs signif-
icantly better in this setting.

5 Conclusions

We presented a system for Electronic Career Guid-
ance utilizing NLP and IR techniques. Given a nat-
ural language professional profile, relevant profes-
sions are computed based on the information about
semantic relatedness. We intrinsically evaluated and
analyzed the properties of two semantic relatedness
measures utilizing the lexical semantic information
in a German wordnet and Wikipedia on the tasks of
estimating semantic relatedness scores and answer-
ing multiple-choice questions. Furthermore, we ap-
plied these measures to an IR task, whereby they
were used either in combination with a set of heuris-
tics or the Wikipedia based measure was used to di-
rectly compute semantic relatedness of topics and

documents. We experimented with three different
query types, which were built from the topics by:
(QT-1) extracting nouns, verbs, adjectives, (QT-2)
extracting only nouns, or (QT-3) manually assign-
ing several keywords to each topic from a tagset of
41 keywords.

In an intrinsic evaluation of LIN and ESA mea-
sures on the task of computing semantic relatedness,
we found that ESA captures the information about
semantic relatedness and non-classical semantic re-
lations considerably better than LIN, which operates
on an is-a hierarchy and, thus, better captures the in-
formation about semantic similarity. On the task of
solving RDWP questions, the ESA measure signif-
icantly outperformed the LIN measure in terms of
correctness. On both tasks, the coverage of ESA is
much better. Despite this, the performance of LIN
and ESA as part of an IR model is only slightly
different. ESA performs better for all lengths of
queries, but the differences are not as significant as
in the intrinsic evaluation. This indicates that the
information provided by both measures, based on
different knowledge bases, might be complementary
for the IR task.

When ESA is applied to directly compute seman-
tic relatedness between topics and documents, it out-
performs IR-1 and the baseline EB model by a large
margin for QT-1 and QT-2 queries. For QT-3, i.e.,
the shortest type of query, it performs worse than
IR-1 utilizing ESA and a set of heuristics. Also,
the performance of the baseline EB model is very
strong in this experimental setting. This result in-
dicates that IR-2 utilizing conventional information
retrieval techniques and semantic information from
Wikipedia is better suited for longer queries provid-
ing enough context. For shorter queries, soft match-

ing techniques utilizing semantic relatedness tend to
be beneficial.

It should be born in mind, that the construction
of QT-3 queries involved a manual step of assigning
the keywords to a given essay. In this experimen-
tal setting, all models show the best performance.
This indicates that professional profiles contain a lot
of noise, so that more sophisticated NLP analysis
of topics is required. This will be improved in our
future work, whereby the system will incorporate
an information extraction component for automat-
ically mapping the professional profile to a set of
keywords. We will also integrate a component for
analyzing the sentiment structure of the profiles. We
believe that the findings from our work on apply-
ing IR techniques to the task of Electronic Career
Guidance generalize to similar application domains,
where topics and documents display similar proper-
ties (with respect to their length, free-text structure
and mismatch of vocabularies) and domain and lex-
ical knowledge is required to achieve high levels of
performance.
