Abstract

We present a novel method for predicting in-
flected word forms for generating morpho-
logically rich languages in machine trans-
lation. We utilize a rich set of syntactic
and morphological knowledge sources from
both source and target sentences in a prob-
abilistic model, and evaluate their contribu-
tion in generating Russian and Arabic sen-
tences. Our results show that the proposed
model substantially outperforms the com-
monly used baseline of a trigram target lan-
guage model; in particular, the use of mor-
phological and syntactic features leads to
large gains in prediction accuracy. We also
show that the proposed method is effective
with a relatively small amount of data.

1 Introduction

Machine Translation (MT) quality has improved
substantially in recent years due to applying data
intensive statistical techniques. However, state-of-
the-art approaches are essentially lexical, consider-
ing every surface word or phrase in both the source
sentence and the corresponding translation as an in-
dependent entity. A shortcoming of this word-based
approach is that it is sensitive to data sparsity. This is
an issue of importance as aligned corpora are an ex-
pensive resource, which is not abundantly available
for many language pairs. This is particularly prob-
lematic for morphologically rich languages, where
word stems are realized in many different surface
forms, which exacerbates the sparsity problem.

∗ This research was conducted during the author’s intern-
ship at Microsoft Research.

In this paper, we explore an approach in which
words are represented as a collection of morpholog-
ical entities, and use this information to aid in MT
for morphologically rich languages. Our goal is two-
fold: first, to allow generalization over morphology
to alleviate the data sparsity problem in morphology
generation. Second, to model syntactic coherence in
the form of morphological agreement in the target
language to improve the generation of morphologi-
cally rich languages. So far, this problem has been
addressed in a very limited manner in MT, most typ-
ically by using a target language model.

In the framework suggested in this paper, we train
a model that predicts the inflected forms of a se-
quence of word stems in a target sentence, given
the corresponding source sentence. We use word
and word alignment information, as well as lexi-
cal resources that provide morphological informa-
tion about the words on both the source and target
sides. Given a sentence pair, we also obtain syntactic
analysis information for both the source and trans-
lated sentences. We generate the inflected forms of
words in the target sentence using all of the available
information, using a log-linear model that learns the
relevant mapping functions.

As a case study, we focus on the English-Russian
and English-Arabic language pairs. Unlike English,
Russian and Arabic have very rich systems of mor-
phology, each with distinct characteristics. Trans-
lating from a morphology-poor to a morphology-
rich language is especially challenging since de-
tailed morphological information needs to be de-
coded from a language that does not encode this in-
formation or does so only implicitly (Koehn, 2005).
We believe that these language pairs are represen-

128



tative in this respect and therefore demonstrate the
generality of our approach.

There are several contributions of this work. First,
we propose a general approach that shows promise
in addressing the challenges of MT into morpholog-
ically rich languages. We show that the use of both
syntactic and morphological information improves
translation quality. We also show the utility of
source language information in predicting the word
forms of the target language. Finally, we achieve
these results with limited morphological resources
and training data, suggesting that the approach is
generally useful for resource-scarce language pairs.

2 Russian and Arabic Morphology

Table 1 describes the morphological features rele-
vant to Russian and Arabic, along with their possible
values. The rightmost column in the table refers to
the morphological features that are shared by Rus-
sian and Arabic, including person, number, gender
and tense. While these features are fairly generic
(they are also present in English), note that Rus-
sian includes an additional gender (neuter) and Ara-
bic has a distinct number notion for two (dual). A
central dimension of Russian morphology is case
marking, realized as suffixation on nouns and nom-
inal modifiers1. The Russian case feature includes
six possible values, representing the notions of sub-
ject, direct object, location, etc. In Arabic, like other
Semitic languages, word surface forms may include
proclitics and enclitics (or prefixes and suffixes as
we refer to them in this paper), concatenated to in-
flected stems. For nouns, prefixes include conjunc-
tions (wa: “and”, fa: “and, so”), prepositions (bi:
“by, with”, ka: “like, such as”, li: “for, to”) and a de-
terminer, and suffixes include possessive pronouns.
Verbal prefixes include conjunction and negation,
and suffixes include object pronouns. Both object
and possessive pronouns are captured by an indica-
tor function for its presence or absence, as well as
by the features that indicate their person, number
and gender. As can be observed from the table, a
large number of surface inflected forms can be gen-
erated by the combination of these features, making

1Case marking also exists in Arabic. However, in many in-
stances, it is realized by diacritics which are ignored in standard
orthography. In our experiments, we include case marking in
Arabic only when it is reflected in the orthography.

the morphological generation of these languages a
non-trivial task.

Morphologically complex languages also tend to
display a rich system of agreements. In Russian, for
example, adjectives agree with head nouns in num-
ber, gender and case, and verbs agree with the sub-
ject noun in person and number (past tense verbs
agree in gender and number). Arabic has a similarly
rich system of agreement, with unique characteris-
tics. For example, in addition to agreement involv-
ing person, number and gender, it also requires a de-
terminer for each word in a definite noun phrase with
adjectival modifiers; in a noun compound, a deter-
miner is attached to the last noun in the chain. Also,
non-human subject plural nouns require the verb to
be inflected in a singular feminine form. Generating
these morphologically complex languages is there-
fore more difficult than generating English in terms
of capturing the agreement phenomena.

3 Related Work

The use of morphological features in language mod-
elling has been explored in the past for morphology-
rich languages. For example, (Duh and Kirchhoff,
2004) showed that factored language models, which
consider morphological features and use an opti-
mized backoff policy, yield lower perplexity.

In the area of MT, there has been a large body
of work attempting to modify the input to a transla-
tion system in order to improve the generated align-
ments for particular language pairs. For example,
it has been shown (Lee, 2004) that determiner seg-
mentation and deletion in Arabic sentences in an
Arabic-to-English translation system improves sen-
tence alignment, thus leading to improved over-
all translation quality. Another work (Koehn and
Knight, 2003) showed improvements by splitting
compounds in German. (Nießen and Ney, 2004)
demonstrated that a similar level of alignment qual-
ity can be achieved with smaller corpora applying
morpho-syntactic source restructuring, using hierar-
chical lexicon models, in translating from German
into English. (Popović and Ney, 2004) experimented
successfully with translating from inflectional lan-
guages into English making use of POS tags, word
stems and suffixes in the source language. More re-
cently, (Goldwater and McClosky, 2005) achieved
improvements in Czech-English MT, optimizing a

set of possible source transformations, incorporat-
ing morphology. In general, this line of work fo-
cused on translating from morphologically rich lan-
guages into English; there has been limited research
in MT in the opposite direction. Koehn (2005) in-
cludes a survey of statistical MT systems in both di-
rections for the Europarl corpus, and points out the
challenges of this task. A recent work (El-Kahlout
and Oflazer, 2006) experimented with English-to-
Turkish translation with limited success, suggesting
that inflection generation given morphological fea-
tures may give positive results.

In the current work, we suggest a probabilistic
framework for morphology generation performed as
post-processing. It can therefore be considered as
complementary to the techniques described above.
Our approach is general in that it is not specific to
a particular language pair, and is novel in that it al-
lows modelling of agreement on the target side. The
framework suggested here is most closely related to
(Suzuki and Toutanova, 2006), which uses a proba-
bilistic model to generate Japanese case markers for
English-to-Japanese MT. This work can be viewed
as a generalization of (Suzuki and Toutanova, 2006)
in that our model generates inflected forms of words,
and is not limited to generating a small, closed set of
case markers. In addition, the morphology genera-
tion problem is more challenging in that it requires
handling of complex agreement phenomena along
multiple morphological dimensions.

4 Inflection Prediction Framework

In this section, we define the task of of morphologi-
cal generation as inflection prediction, as well as the

lexical operations relevant for the task.

4.1 Morphology Analysis and Generation

Morphological analysis can be performed by ap-
plying language specific rules. These may include
a full-scale morphological analysis with contextual
disambiguation, or, when such resources are not
available, simple heuristic rules, such as regarding
the last few characters of a word as its morphogical
suffix. In this work, we assume that lexicons LS and
LT are available for the source and translation lan-
guages, respectively. Such lexicons can be created
manually, or automatically from data. Given a lexi-
con L and a surface word w, we define the following
operations:

• Stemming - let Sw = {s
1, ..., sl} be the set of

possible morphological stems (lemmas) of w
according to L.2

• Inflection - let Iw = {i
1, ..., im} be the set of

surface form words that have the same stem as
w. That is, i ∈ Iw iff Si

⋂

Sw 6= ∅.

• Morphological analysis - let Aw = {a
1, ..., av}

be the set of possible morphological analyses
for w. A morphological analysis a is a vector of
categorical values, where the dimensions and
possible values for each dimension in the vector
representation space are defined by L.

4.2 The Task

We assume that we are given aligned sentence pairs,
where a sentence pair includes a source and a tar-

2Multiple stems are possible due to ambiguity in morpho-
logical analysis.

get sentence, and lexicons LS and LT that support
the operations described in the section above. Let
a sentence w1, ...wt, ...wn be the output of a MT
system in the target language. This sentence can
be converted into the corresponding stem set se-
quence S1, ...St, ...Sn, applying the stemming op-
eration. Then the task is, for every stem set St in
the output sentence, to predict an inflection yt from
its inflection set It. The predicted inflections should
both reflect the meaning conveyed by the source sen-
tence, and comply with the agreement rules of the
target language. 3

Figure 1 shows an example of an aligned English-
Russian sentence pair: on the source (English) side,
POS tags and word dependency structure are indi-
cated by solid arcs. The alignments between En-
glish and Russian words are indicated by the dot-
ted lines. The dependency structure on the Russian
side, indicated by solid arcs, is given by a treelet MT
system in our case (see Section 6.1), projected from
the word dependency structure of English and word
alignment information. Note that the Russian sen-
tence displays agreement in number and gender be-
tween the subject noun (raspredelenie) and the pred-
icate (zaversheno); note also that resursov is in gen-
itive case, as it modifies the noun on its left.

5 Models for Inflection Prediction

5.1 A Probabilistic Model

Our learning framework uses a Maximum Entropy
Markov model (McCallum et al., 2000). The model
decomposes the overall probability of a predicted
inflection sequence into a product of local proba-
bilities for individual word predictions. The local

3That is, assuming that the stem sequence that is output by
the MT system is correct.

probabilities are conditioned on the previous k pre-
dictions. The model implemented here is of second
order: at any decision point t we condition the prob-
ability distribution over labels on the previous two
predictions yt−1 and yt−2 in addition to the given
(static) word context from both the source and tar-
get sentences. That is, the probability of a predicted
inflection sequence is defined as follows:

p(y | x) =
n

∏

t=1

p(yt | yt−1, yt−2, xt), yt ∈ It

where xt denotes the given context at position t
and It is the set of inflections corresponding to St,
from which the model should choose yt.

The features we constructed pair up predicates on
the context ( x̄, yt−1, yt−2) and the target label (yt).
In the suggested framework, it is straightforward to
encode the morphological properties of a word, in
addition to its surface inflected form. For example,
for a particular inflected word form yt and its con-
text, the derived paired features may include:

φk =

{

1 if surface word yt is y
′ and s′ ∈ St+1

0 otherwise

φk+1 =
{

1 if Gender(yt) =“Fem” and Gender(yt−1) =“Fem”
0 otherwise

In the first example, a given neighboring stem set
St+1 is used as a context feature for predicting the
target word yt. The second feature captures the gen-
der agreement with the previous word. This is possi-
ble because our model is of second order. Thus, we
can derive context features describing the morpho-
logical properties of the two previous predictions.4

Note that our model is not a simple multi-class clas-
sifier, because our features are shared across mul-
tiple target labels. For example, the gender fea-
ture above applies to many different inflected forms.
Therefore, it is a structured prediction model, where
the structure is defined by the morphological proper-
ties of the target predictions, in addition to the word
sequence decomposition.

5.2 Feature Categories

The information available for estimating the distri-
bution over yt can be split into several categories,

4Note that while we decompose the prediction task left-to-
right, an appealing alternative is to define a top-down decompo-
sition, traversing the dependency tree of the sentence. However,
this requires syntactic analysis of sufficient quality.

corresponding to feature source. The first ma-
jor distinction is monolingual versus bilingual fea-
tures: monolingual features refer only to the context
(and predicted label) in the target language, while
bilingual features have access to information in the
source sentences, obtained by traversing the word
alignment links from target words to a (set of) source
words, as shown in Figure 1.

Both monolingual and bilingual features can be
further split into three classes: lexical, morpholog-
ical and syntactic. Lexical features refer to surface
word forms, as well as their stems. Since our model
is of second order, our monolingual lexical fea-
tures include the features of a standard word trigram
language model. Furthermore, since our model is
discriminative (predicting word forms given their
stems), the monolingual lexical model can use stems
in addition to predicted words for the left and cur-
rent position, as well as stems from the right con-
text. Morphological features are those that refer to
the features given in Table 1. Morphological infor-
mation is used in describing the target label as well
as its context, and is intended to capture morpho-
logical generalizations. Finally, syntactic features
can make use of syntactic analyses of the source
and target sentences. Such analyses may be derived
for the target language, using the pre-stemmed sen-
tence. Without loss of generality, we will use here
a dependency parsing paradigm. Given a syntactic
analysis, one can construct syntactic features; for ex-
ample, the stem of the parent word of yt. Syntactic
features are expected to be useful in capturing agree-
ment phenomena.

5.3 Features

Table 2 gives the full set of suggested features for
Russian and Arabic, detailed by type. For monolin-
gual lexical features, we consider the stems of the
predicted word and its immediately adjacent words,
in addition to traditional word bigram and trigram
features. For monolingual morphological features,
we consider the morphological attributes of the two
previously predicted words and the current predic-
tion; for monolingual syntactic features, we use the
stem of the parent node.

The bilingual features include the set of words
aligned to the focus word at position t, where they
are treated as bag-of-words, i.e., each aligned word

Table 2: The feature set suggested for English-
Russian and English-Arabic pairs

is assigned a separate feature. Bilingual lexical fea-
tures can refer to words aligned to yt as all as words
aligned to its immediate neighbors yt−1 and yt+1.
Bilingual morphological and syntactic features re-
fer to the features of the source language, which
are expected to be useful for predicting morphol-
ogy in the target language. For example, the bilin-
gual Det (determiner) feature is computed accord-
ing to the source dependency tree: if a child of a
word aligned to wt is a determiner, then the fea-
ture value is assigned its surface word form (such
as a or the). The bilingual Prep feature is com-
puted similarly, by checking the parent chain of the
word aligned to wt for the existence of a preposi-
tion. This feature is hoped to be useful for predict-
ing Arabic inflected forms with a prepositional pre-
fix, as well as for predicting case marking in Rus-
sian. The bilingual ObjPron and PossPron features
represent any object pronoun of the word aligned to
wt and a preceding possessive pronoun, respectively.
These features are expected to map to the object and
possessive pronoun features in Arabic. Finally, the
bilingual Compound feature checks whether a word
appears as part of a noun compound in the English
source. f this is the case, the feature is assigned the
value of “head” or “dependent”. This feature is rel-
evant for predicting a genitive case in Russian and
definiteness in Arabic.

6 Experimental Settings

In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the sug-
gested approach, we performed reference experi-
ments, that is, using the aligned sentence pairs of

reference translations rather than the output of an
MT system as input.5 This allows us to evaluate
our method with a reduced noise level, as the words
and word order are perfect in reference translations.
These experiments thus constitute a preliminary step
for tackling the real task of inflecting words in MT.

6.1 Data

We used a corpus of approximately 1 million aligned
sentence pairs for English-Russian, and 0.5 million
pairs for English-Arabic. Both corpora are from a
technical (software manual) domain, which we be-
lieve is somewhat restricted along some morpho-
logical dimensions, such as tense and person. We
used 1,000 sentence pairs each for development and
testing for both language pairs. The details of the
datasets used are given in Table 3.

The sentence pairs were word-aligned using
GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2000) and submitted to a
treelet-based MT system (Quirk et al., 2005), which
uses the word dependency structure of the source
language and projects word dependency structure to
the target language, creating the structure shown in
Figure 1 above.

6.2 Lexicon

Table 4 gives some relevant statistics of the lexicons
we used. For Russian, a general-domain lexicon was
available to us, consisting of about 80,000 lemmas
(stems) and 9.4 inflected forms per stem.6 Limiting
the lexicon to word types that are seen in the train-
ing set reduces its size substantially to about 14,000
stems, and an average of 3.8 inflections per stem.
We will use this latter “domain-adapted” lexicon in
our experiments.

5In this case, yt should equal wt, according to the task defi-
nition.

6The averages reported in Table 4 are by type and do not
consider word frequencies in the data.

Lexicon ∩ Train 13,929 3.8 1.6
Ara. Lexicon ∩ Train 12,670 7.0 1.7

Table 4: Lexicon statistics

For Arabic, as a full-size Arabic lexicon was not
available to us, we used the Buckwalter morpholog-
ical analyzer (Buckwalter, 2004) to derive a lexicon.
To acquire the stemming and inflection operators, we
submit all words in our training data to the Buckwal-
ter analyzer. Note that Arabic displays a high level
of ambiguity, each word corresponding to many pos-
sible segmentations and morphological analyses; we
considered all of the different stems returned by the
Buckwalter analyzer in creating a word’s stem set.
The lexicon created in this manner contains 12,670
distinct stems and 89,360 inflected forms.

For the generation of word features, we only con-
sider one dominant analysis for any surface word
for simplicity. In case of ambiguity, we considered
only the first (arbitrary) analysis for Russian. For
Arabic, we apply the following heuristic: use the
most frequent analysis estimated from the gold stan-
dard labels in the Arabic Treebank (Maamouri et al.,
2005); if a word does not appear in the treebank, we
choose the first analysis returned by the Buckwal-
ter analyzer. Ideally, the best word analysis should
be provided as a result of contextual disambiguation
(e.g., (Habash and Rambow, 2005)); we leave this
for future work.

6.3 Baseline

As a baseline, we pick a morphological inflection yt
at random from It. This random baseline serves as
an indicator for the difficulty of the problem. An-
other more competitive baseline we implemented
is a word trigram language model (LM). The LMs
were trained using the CMU language modelling
toolkit (Clarkson and Rosenfeld, 1997) with default
settings on the training data described in Table 3.

6.4 Experiments

In the experiments, our primary goal is to evaluate
the effectiveness of the proposed model using all
features available to us. Additionally, we are inter-
ested in knowing the contribution of each informa-
tion source, namely of morpho-syntactic and bilin-
gual features. Therefore, we study the performance

133



of models including the full feature schemata as well
as models that are restricted to feature subsets ac-
cording to the feature types as described in Section
5.2. The models are as follows: Monolingual-Word,
including LM-like and stem n-gram features only;
Bilingual-Word, which also includes bilingual lex-
ical features;7 Monolingual-All, which has access
to all the information available in the target lan-
guage, including morphological and syntactic fea-
tures; and finally, Bilingual-All, which includes all
feature types from Table 2.

For each model and language, we perform feature
selection in the following manner. The features are
represented as feature templates, such as ”POS=X”,
which generate a set of binary features correspond-
ing to different instantiations of the template, as in
”POS=NOUN”. In addition to individual features, con-
junctions of up to three features are also considered
for selection (e.g., ”POS=NOUN & Number=plural”).
Every conjunction of feature templates considered
contains at least one predicate on the prediction yt,
and up to two predicates on the context. The feature
selection algorithm performs a greedy forward step-
wise feature selection on the feature templates so as
to maximize development set accuracy. The algo-
rithm is similar to the one described in (Toutanova,
2006). After this process, we performed some man-
ual inspection of the selected templates, and finally
obtained 11 and 36 templates for the Monolingual-
All and Bilingual-All settings for Russian, respec-
tively. These templates generated 7.9 million and
9.3 million binary feature instantiations in the fi-
nal model, respectively. The corresponding num-
bers for Arabic were 27 feature templates (0.7 mil-
lion binary instantiations) and 39 feature templates
(2.3 million binary instantiations) for Monolingual-
All and Bilingual-All, respectively.

7 Results and Discussion

Table 5 shows the accuracy of predicting word forms
for the baseline and proposed models. We report ac-
curacy only on words that appear in our lexicons.
Thus, punctuation, English words occurring in the
target sentence, and words with unknown lemmas
are excluded from the evaluation. The reported ac-
curacy measure therefore abstracts away from the is-

is available to a state-of-the-art statistical MT system.

sue of incomplete coverage of the lexicon. When
we encounter these words in the true MT scenario,
we will make no predictions about them, and simply
leave them unmodified. In our current experiments,
in Russian, 68.2% of all word tokens were in Cyril-
lic, of which 93.8% were included in our lexicon.
In Arabic, 85.5% of all word tokens were in Arabic
characters, of which 99.1% were in our lexicon.8

The results in Table 5 show that the suggested
models outperform the language model substantially
for both languages. In particular, the contribution of
both bilingual and non-lexical features is notewor-
thy: adding non-lexical features consistently leads
to 1.5% to 2% absolute gain in both monolingual
and bilingual settings in both language pairs. We
obtain a particularly large gain in the Russian bilin-
gual case, in which the absolute gain is more than
4%, translating to 34% error rate reduction. Adding
bilingual features has a similar effect of gaining
about 2% (and 4% for Russian non-lexical) in ac-
curacy over monolingual models. The overall accu-
racy is lower in Arabic than in Russian, reflecting
the inherent difficulty of the task, as indicated by the
random baseline (31.7 in Russian vs. 16.3 in Ara-
bic).

In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the model
in alleviating the data sparsity problem in morpho-
logical generation, we trained inflection prediction
models on various subsets of the training data de-
scribed in Table 3, and tested their accuracy. The
results are given in Figure 2. We can see that with as
few as 5,000 training sentences pairs, the model ob-
tains much better accuracy than the language model,
which is trained on data that is larger by a few orders
of magnitude. We also note that the learning curve

8For Arabic, the inflection ambiguity was extremely high:
there were on average 39 inflected forms per stem set in our
development corpus (per token), as opposed to 7 in Russian.
We therefore limited the evaluation of Arabic to those stems that
have up to 30 inflected forms, resulting in 17 inflected forms per
stem set on average in the development data.

Figure 2: Accuracy, varying training data size

becomes less steep as we use more training data,
suggesting that the models are successfully learning
generalizations.

We have also manually examined some repre-
sentative cases where the proposed model failed to
make a correct prediction. In both Russian and Ara-
bic, a very common pattern was a mistake in pre-
dicting the gender (as well as number and person in
Arabic) of pronouns. This may be attributed to the
fact that the correct choice of the pronoun requires
coreference resolution, which is not available in our
model. A more thorough analysis of the results will
be helpful to bring further improvements.

8 Conclusions and Future Work

We presented a probabilistic framework for mor-
phological generation given aligned sentence pairs,
incorporating morpho-syntactic information from
both the source and target sentences. The re-
sults, using reference translations, show that the pro-
posed models achieve substantially better accuracy
than language models, even with a relatively small
amount of training data. Our models using morpho-
syntactic information also outperformed models us-
ing only lexical information by a wide margin. This
result is very promising for achieving our ultimate
goal of improving MT output by using a special-
ized model for target language morphological gener-
ation. Though this goal is clearly outside the scope
of this paper, we conducted a preliminary experi-
ment where an English-to-Russian MT system was
trained on a stemmed version of the aligned data and
used to generate stemmed word sequences, which
were then inflected using the suggested framework.
This simple integration of the proposed model with

the MT system improved the BLEU score by 1.7.
The most obvious next step of our research, there-
fore, is to further pursue the integration of the pro-
posed model to the end-to-end MT scenario.

There are multiple paths for obtaining further im-
provements over the results presented here. These
include refinement in feature design, word analysis
disambiguation, morphological and syntactic anal-
ysis on the source English side (e.g., assigning se-
mantic role tags), to name a few. Another area of
investigation is capturing longer-distance agreement
phenomena, which can be done by implementing a
global statistical model, or by using features from
dependency trees more effectively.
