Abstract

We describe an approach to domain adapta-
tion that is appropriate exactly in the case
when one has enough “target” data to do
slightly better than just using only “source”
data. Our approach is incredibly simple,
easy to implement as a preprocessing step
(10 lines of Perl!) and outperforms state-
of-the-art approaches on a range of datasets.
Moreover, it is trivially extended to a multi-
domain adaptation problem, where one has
data from a variety of different domains.

1 Introduction

The task of domain adaptation is to develop learn-
ing algorithms that can be easily ported from one
domain to another—say, from newswire to biomed-
ical documents. This problem is particularly inter-
esting in NLP because we are often in the situation
that we have a large collection of labeled data in one
“source” domain (say, newswire) but truly desire a
model that performs well in a second “target” do-
main. The approach we present in this paper is based
on the idea of transforming the domain adaptation
learning problem into a standard supervised learn-
ing problem to which any standard algorithm may
be applied (eg., maxent, SVMs, etc.). Our transfor-
mation is incredibly simple: we augment the feature
space of both the source and target data and use the
result as input to a standard learning algorithm.

There are roughly two varieties of the domain
adaptation problem that have been addressed in the
literature: the fully supervised case and the semi-

supervised case. The fully supervised case mod-
els the following scenario. We have access to a
large, annotated corpus of data from a source do-
main. In addition, we spend a little money to anno-
tate a small corpus in the target domain. We want to
leverage both annotated datasets to obtain a model
that performs well on the target domain. The semi-
supervised case is similar, but instead of having a
small annotated target corpus, we have a large but
unannotated target corpus. In this paper, we focus
exclusively on the fully supervised case.

One particularly nice property of our approach
is that it is incredibly easy to implement: the Ap-
pendix provides a 10 line, 194 character Perl script
for performing the complete transformation (avail-
able at http://hal3.name/easyadapt.pl.gz). In
addition to this simplicity, our algorithm performs as
well as (or, in some cases, better than) current state
of the art techniques.

2 Problem Formalization and Prior Work

To facilitate discussion, we first introduce some no-
tation. Denote by X the input space (typically either
a real vector or a binary vector), and by Y the output
space. We will write Ds to denote the distribution
over source examples and Dt to denote the distri-
bution over target examples. We assume access to
a samples Ds ∼ Ds of source examples from the
source domain, and samples Dt ∼ Dt of target ex-
amples from the target domain. We will assume that
Ds is a collection of N examples and Dt is a col-
lection of M examples (where, typically, N ≫ M ).
Our goal is to learn a function h : X → Y with
low expected loss with respect to the target domain.

256



For the purposes of discussion, we will suppose that
X = RF and that Y = {−1, +1}. However, most
of the techniques described in this section (as well
as our own technique) are more general.

There are several “obvious” ways to attack the
domain adaptation problem without developing new
algorithms. Many of these are presented and evalu-
ated by Daumé III and Marcu (2006).

The SRCONLY baseline ignores the target data and
trains a single model, only on the source data.

The TGTONLY baseline trains a single model only
on the target data.

The ALL baseline simply trains a standard learning
algorithm on the union of the two datasets.

A potential problem with the ALL baseline is that
if N ≫ M , then Ds may “wash out” any affect
Dt might have. We will discuss this problem in
more detail later, but one potential solution is
to re-weight examples from Ds. For instance,
if N = 10×M , we may weight each example
from the source domain by 0.1. The next base-
line, WEIGHTED, is exactly this approach, with
the weight chosen by cross-validation.

The PRED baseline is based on the idea of using
the output of the source classifier as a feature in
the target classifier. Specifically, we first train a
SRCONLY model. Then we run the SRCONLY
model on the target data (training, development
and test). We use the predictions made by
the SRCONLY model as additional features and
train a second model on the target data, aug-
mented with this new feature.

In the LININT baseline, we linearly interpolate
the predictions of the SRCONLY and the TG-
TONLY models. The interpolation parameter is
adjusted based on target development data.

These baselines are actually surprisingly difficult
to beat. To date, there are two models that have
successfully defeated them on a handful of datasets.
The first model, which we shall refer to as the PRIOR
model, was first introduced by Chelba and Acero
(2004). The idea of this model is to use the SR-
CONLY model as a prior on the weights for a sec-
ond model, trained on the target data. Chelba and
Acero (2004) describe this approach within the con-
text of a maximum entropy classifier, but the idea

is more general. In particular, for many learning
algorithms (maxent, SVMs, averaged perceptron,
naive Bayes, etc.), one regularizes the weight vec-
tor toward zero. In other words, all of these algo-
rithms contain a regularization term on the weights
w of the form λ ||w||22. In the generalized PRIOR
model, we simply replace this regularization term
with λ ||w −ws||22, where w

s is the weight vector
learned in the SRCONLY model.1 In this way, the
model trained on the target data “prefers” to have
weights that are similar to the weights from the SR-
CONLY model, unless the data demands otherwise.
Daumé III and Marcu (2006) provide empirical evi-
dence on four datasets that the PRIOR model outper-
forms the baseline approaches.

More recently, Daumé III and Marcu (2006) pre-
sented an algorithm for domain adaptation for max-
imum entropy classifiers. The key idea of their ap-
proach is to learn three separate models. One model
captures “source specific” information, one captures
“target specific” information and one captures “gen-
eral” information. The distinction between these
three sorts of information is made on a per-example
basis. In this way, each source example is consid-
ered either source specific or general, while each
target example is considered either target specific or
general. Daumé III and Marcu (2006) present an EM
algorithm for training their model. This model con-
sistently outperformed all the baseline approaches
as well as the PRIOR model. Unfortunately, despite
the empirical success of this algorithm, it is quite
complex to implement and is roughly 10 to 15 times
slower than training the PRIOR model.

3 Adaptation by Feature Augmentation

In this section, we describe our approach to the do-
main adaptation problem. Essentially, all we are go-
ing to do is take each feature in the original problem
and make three versions of it: a general version, a
source-specific version and a target-specific version.
The augmented source data will contain only general
and source-specific versions. The augmented target

ing algorithms, modifying the regularization term is simple be-
cause it appears explicitly. For the perceptron algorithm, one
can obtain an equivalent regularization by performing standard
perceptron updates, but using (w + ws)⊤x for making predic-
tions rather than simply w⊤x.

257



data contains general and target-specific versions.
To state this more formally, first recall the nota-

tion from Section 2: X and Y are the input and
output spaces, respectively; Ds is the source do-
main data set and Dt is the target domain data set.
Suppose for simplicity that X = RF for some
F > 0. We will define our augmented input space
by X̆ = R3F . Then, define mappings Φs, Φt :
X → X̆ for mapping the source and target data
respectively. These are defined by Eq (1), where
0 = 〈0, 0, . . . , 0〉 ∈ RF is the zero vector.

Φs(x) = 〈x, x,0〉, Φt(x) = 〈x,0, x〉 (1)

Before we proceed with a formal analysis of this
transformation, let us consider why it might be ex-
pected to work. Suppose our task is part of speech
tagging, our source domain is the Wall Street Journal
and our target domain is a collection of reviews of
computer hardware. Here, a word like “the” should
be tagged as a determiner in both cases. However,
a word like “monitor” is more likely to be a verb
in the WSJ and more likely to be a noun in the hard-
ware corpus. Consider a simple case whereX = R2,
where x1 indicates if the word is “the” and x2 indi-
cates if the word is “monitor.” Then, in X̆ , x̆1 and x̆2
will be “general” versions of the two indicator func-
tions, x̆3 and x̆4 will be source-specific versions, and
x̆5 and x̆6 will be target-specific versions.

Now, consider what a learning algorithm could do
to capture the fact that the appropriate tag for “the”
remains constant across the domains, and the tag
for “monitor” changes. In this case, the model can
set the “determiner” weight vector to something like
〈1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0〉. This places high weight on the com-
mon version of “the” and indicates that “the” is most
likely a determiner, regardless of the domain. On
the other hand, the weight vector for “noun” might
look something like 〈0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1〉, indicating that
the word “monitor” is a noun only in the target do-
main. Similar, the weight vector for “verb” might
look like 〈0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0〉, indicating the “monitor” is
a verb only in the source domain.

Note that this expansion is actually redundant.
We could equally well use Φs(x) = 〈x, x〉 and
Φt(x) = 〈x,0〉. However, it turns out that it is eas-
ier to analyze the first case, so we will stick with

that. Moreover, the first case has the nice property
that it is straightforward to generalize it to the multi-
domain adaptation problem: when there are more
than two domains. In general, for K domains, the
augmented feature space will consist of K+1 copies
of the original feature space.

3.1 A Kernelized Version

It is straightforward to derive a kernelized version of
the above approach. We do not exploit this property
in our experiments—all are conducted with a simple
linear kernel. However, by deriving the kernelized
version, we gain some insight into the method. For
this reason, we sketch the derivation here.

Suppose that the data points x are drawn from a
reproducing kernel Hilbert space X with kernel K :
X × X → R, with K positive semi-definite. Then,
K can be written as the dot product (in X ) of two
(perhaps infinite-dimensional) vectors: K(x, x′) =
〈Φ(x), Φ(x′)〉X . Define Φ

s and Φt in terms of Φ, as:

Φs(x) = 〈Φ(x), Φ(x),0〉 (2)

Φt(x) = 〈Φ(x),0, Φ(x)〉

Now, we can compute the kernel product be-
tween Φs and Φt in the expanded RKHS by mak-
ing use of the original kernel K. We denote the ex-
panded kernel by K̆(x, x′). It is simplest to first de-
scribe K̆(x, x′) when x and x′ are from the same
domain, then analyze the case when the domain
differs. When the domain is the same, we get:
K̆(x, x′) = 〈Φ(x), Φ(x′)〉X + 〈Φ(x), Φ(x

′)〉X =
2K(x, x′). When they are from different domains,
we get: K̆(x, x′) = 〈Φ(x), Φ(x′)〉X = K(x, x

′).
Putting this together, we have:

K̆(x, x′) =

{

2K(x, x′) same domain
K(x, x′) diff. domain

(3)

This is an intuitively pleasing result. What it
says is that—considering the kernel as a measure
of similarity—data points from the same domain are
“by default” twice as similar as those from differ-
ent domains. Loosely speaking, this means that data
points from the target domain have twice as much
influence as source points when making predictions
about test target data.

258



3.2 Analysis

We first note an obvious property of the feature-
augmentation approach. Namely, it does not make
learning harder, in a minimum Bayes error sense. A
more interesting statement would be that it makes
learning easier, along the lines of the result of (Ben-
David et al., 2006) — note, however, that their re-
sults are for the “semi-supervised” domain adapta-
tion problem and so do not apply directly. As yet,
we do not know a proper formalism in which to an-
alyze the fully supervised case.

It turns out that the feature-augmentation method
is remarkably similar to the PRIOR model2. Sup-
pose we learn feature-augmented weights in a clas-
sifier regularized by an ℓ2 norm (eg., SVMs, maxi-
mum entropy). We can denote by ws the sum of the
“source” and “general” components of the learned
weight vector, and by wt the sum of the “target” and
“general” components, so that ws and wt are the pre-
dictive weights for each task. Then, the regulariza-
tion condition on the entire weight vector is approx-
imately ||wg||

2
+ ||ws − wg||

2
+ ||wt − wg||

2, with
free parameter wg which can be chosen to minimize
this sum. This leads to a regularizer proportional to
||ws − wt||

2, akin to the PRIOR model.
Given this similarity between the feature-

augmentation method and the PRIOR model, one
might wonder why we expect our approach to do
better. Our belief is that this occurs because we op-
timize ws and wt jointly, not sequentially. First, this
means that we do not need to cross-validate to es-
timate good hyperparameters for each task (though
in our experiments, we do not use any hyperparam-
eters). Second, and more importantly, this means
that the single supervised learning algorithm that
is run is allowed to regulate the trade-off between
source/target and general weights. In the PRIOR
model, we are forced to use the prior variance on
in the target learning scenario to do this ourselves.

3.3 Multi-domain adaptation

Our formulation is agnostic to the number of
“source” domains. In particular, it may be the case
that the source data actually falls into a variety of
more specific domains. This is simple to account
for in our model. In the two-domain case, we ex-

panded the feature space from RF to R3F . For a
K-domain problem, we simply expand the feature
space to R(K+1)F in the obvious way (the “+1” cor-
responds to the “general domain” while each of the
other 1 . . .K correspond to a single task).

4 Results

In this section we describe experimental results on a
wide variety of domains. First we describe the tasks,
then we present experimental results, and finally we
look more closely at a few of the experiments.

4.1 Tasks

All tasks we consider are sequence labeling tasks
(either named-entity recognition, shallow parsing or
part-of-speech tagging) on the following datasets:
ACE-NER. We use data from the 2005 Automatic

Content Extraction task, restricting ourselves to
the named-entity recognition task. The 2005
ACE data comes from 5 domains: Broad-
cast News (bn), Broadcast Conversations (bc),
Newswire (nw), Weblog (wl), Usenet (un) and
Converstaional Telephone Speech (cts).

CoNLL-NE. Similar to ACE-NER, a named-entity
recognition task. The difference is: we use the
2006 ACE data as the source domain and the
CoNLL 2003 NER data as the target domain.

PubMed-POS. A part-of-speech tagging problem
on PubMed abstracts introduced by Blitzer et
al. (2006). There are two domains: the source
domain is the WSJ portion of the Penn Tree-
bank and the target domain is PubMed.

CNN-Recap. This is a recapitalization task intro-
duced by Chelba and Acero (2004) and also
used by Daumé III and Marcu (2006). The
source domain is newswire and the target do-
main is the output of an ASR system.

Treebank-Chunk. This is a shallow parsing task
based on the data from the Penn Treebank. This
data comes from a variety of domains: the stan-
dard WSJ domain (we use the same data as for
CoNLL 2000), the ATIS switchboard domain,
and the Brown corpus (which is, itself, assem-
bled from six subdomains).

Treebank-Brown. This is identical to the Treebank-
Chunk task, except that we consider all of the
Brown corpus to be a single domain.

Table 1: Task statistics; columns are task, domain,
size of the training, development and test sets, and
the number of unique features in the training set.

In all cases (except for CNN-Recap), we use
roughly the same feature set, which has become
somewhat standardized: lexical information (words,
stems, capitalization, prefixes and suffixes), mem-
bership on gazetteers, etc. For the CNN-Recap task,
we use identical feature to those used by both Chelba
and Acero (2004) and Daumé III and Marcu (2006):
the current, previous and next word, and 1-3 letter
prefixes and suffixes.

Statistics on the tasks and datasets are in Table 1.

In all cases, we use the SEARN algorithm for solv-
ing the sequence labeling problem (Daumé III et al.,
2007) with an underlying averaged perceptron clas-
sifier; implementation due to (Daumé III, 2004). For
structural features, we make a second-order Markov
assumption and only place a bias feature on the tran-
sitions. For simplicity, we optimize and report only
on label accuracy (but require that our outputs be
parsimonious: we do not allow “I-NP” to follow
“B-PP,” for instance). We do this for three rea-
sons. First, our focus in this work is on building
better learning algorithms and introducing a more
complicated measure only serves to mask these ef-
fects. Second, it is arguable that a measure like F1 is
inappropriate for chunking tasks (Manning, 2006).

Third, we can easily compute statistical significance
over accuracies using McNemar’s test.

4.2 Experimental Results

The full—somewhat daunting—table of results is
presented in Table 2. The first two columns spec-
ify the task and domain. For the tasks with only a
single source and target, we simply report results on
the target. For the multi-domain adaptation tasks,
we report results for each setting of the target (where
all other data-sets are used as different “source” do-
mains). The next set of eight columns are the error
rates for the task, using one of the different tech-
niques (“AUGMENT” is our proposed technique).
For each row, the error rate of the best performing
technique is bolded (as are all techniques whose per-
formance is not statistically significantly different at
the 95% level). The “T<S” column is contains a “+”
whenever TGTONLY outperforms SRCONLY (this
will become important shortly). The final column
indicates when AUGMENT comes in first.3

There are several trends to note in the results. Ex-
cluding for a moment the “br-*” domains on the
Treebank-Chunk task, our technique always per-
forms best. Still excluding “br-*”, the clear second-
place contestant is the PRIOR model, a finding con-
sistent with prior research. When we repeat the
Treebank-Chunk task, but lumping all of the “br-*”
data together into a single “brown” domain, the story
reverts to what we expected before: our algorithm
performs best, followed by the PRIOR method.

Importantly, this simple story breaks down on the
Treebank-Chunk task for the eight sections of the
Brown corpus. For these, our AUGMENT technique
performs rather poorly. Moreover, there is no clear
winning approach on this task. Our hypothesis is
that the common feature of these examples is that
these are exactly the tasks for which SRCONLY out-
performs TGTONLY (with one exception: CoNLL).
This seems like a plausible explanation, since it im-
plies that the source and target domains may not be
that different. If the domains are so similar that
a large amount of source data outperforms a small
amount of target data, then it is unlikely that blow-

3One advantage of using the averaged perceptron for all ex-
periments is that the only tunable hyperparameter is the number
of iterations. In all cases, we run 20 iterations and choose the
one with the lowest error on development data.

ing up the feature space will help.
We additionally ran the MEGAM model (Daumé

III and Marcu, 2006) on these data (though not
in the multi-conditional case; for this, we consid-
ered the single source as the union of all sources).
The results are not displayed in Table 2 to save
space. For the majority of results, MEGAM per-
formed roughly comparably to the best of the sys-
tems in the table. In particular, it was not sta-
tistically significantly different that AUGMENT on:
ACE-NER, CoNLL, PubMed, Treebank-chunk-wsj,
Treebank-chunk-swbd3, CNN and Treebank-brown.
It did outperform AUGMENT on the Treebank-chunk
on the Treebank-chunk-br-* data sets, but only out-
performed the best other model on these data sets
for br-cg, br-cm and br-cp. However, despite its
advantages on these data sets, it was quite signifi-
cantly slower to train: a single run required about ten
times longer than any of the other models (including
AUGMENT), and also required five-to-ten iterations
of cross-validation to tune its hyperparameters so as
to achieve these results.

4.3 Model Introspection

One explanation of our model’s improved perfor-
mance is simply that by augmenting the feature
space, we are creating a more powerful model.
While this may be a partial explanation, here we
show that what the model learns about the various

rent position.

domains actually makes some plausible sense.

We perform this analysis only on the ACE-NER
data by looking specifically at the learned weights.
That is, for any given feature f , there will be seven
versions of f : one corresponding to the “cross-
domain” f and seven corresponding to each domain.
We visualize these weights, using Hinton diagrams,
to see how the weights vary across domains.

For example, consider the feature “current word
has an initial capital letter and is then followed by
one or more lower-case letters.” This feature is pre-
sumably useless for data that lacks capitalization in-
formation, but potentially quite useful for other do-
mains. In Figure 1 we shown a Hinton diagram for
this figure. Each column in this figure correspond
to a domain (the top row is the “general domain”).

Each row corresponds to a class.4 Black boxes cor-
respond to negative weights and white boxes corre-
spond to positive weights. The size of the box de-
picts the absolute value of the weight.

As we can see from Figure 1, the /Aa+/ feature
is a very good indicator of entity-hood (it’s value is
strongly positive for all four entity classes), regard-
less of domain (i.e., for the “*” domain). The lack
of boxes in the “bn” column means that, beyond the
settings in “*”, the broadcast news is agnostic with
respect to this feature. This makes sense: there is
no capitalization in broadcast news domain, so there
would be no sense is setting these weights to any-
thing by zero. The usenet column is filled with neg-
ative weights. While this may seem strange, it is
due to the fact that many email addresses and URLs
match this pattern, but are not entities.

Figure 2 depicts a similar figure for the feature
“word is ’bush’ at the current position” (this figure is
case sensitive).5 These weights are somewhat harder
to interpret. What is happening is that “by default”
the word “bush” is going to be a person—this is be-
cause it rarely appears referring to a plant and so
even in the capitalized domains like broadcast con-
versations, if it appears at all, it is a person. The
exception is that in the conversations data, people
do actually talk about bushes as plants, and so the
weights are set accordingly. The weights are high in
the usenet domain because people tend to talk about
the president without capitalizing his name.

4Technically there are many more classes than are shown
here. We do not depict the smallest classes, and have merged
the “Begin-*” and “In-*” weights for each entity type.

5The scale of weights across features is not comparable, so
do not try to compare Figure 1 with Figure 2.

Figure 4: Hinton diagram for feature /the/ at previ-

Figure 3 presents the Hinton diagram for the fea-
ture “word at the current position is ’the”’ (again,
case-sensitive). In general, it appears, “the” is a
common word in entities in all domain except for
broadcast news and conversations. The exceptions
are broadcast news and conversations. These excep-
tions crop up because of the capitalization issue.

In Figure 4, we show the diagram for the feature
“previous word is ’the’.” The only domain for which
this is a good feature of entity-hood is broadcast
conversations (to a much lesser extent, newswire).
This occurs because of four phrases very common in
the broadcast conversations and rare elsewhere: “the
Iraqi people” (“Iraqi” is a GPE), “the Pentagon” (an
ORG), “the Bush (cabinet|advisors|. . . )” (PER), and
“the South” (LOC).

Finally, Figure 5 shows the Hinton diagram for
the feature “the current word is on a list of com-
mon names” (this feature is case-insensitive). All
around, this is a good feature for picking out people
and nothing else. The two exceptions are: it is also
a good feature for other entity types for broadcast

news and it is not quite so good for people in usenet.
The first is easily explained: in broadcast news, it
is very common to refer to countries and organiza-
tions by the name of their respective leaders. This is
essentially a metonymy issue, but as the data is an-
notated, these are marked by their true referent. For
usenet, it is because the list of names comes from
news data, but usenet names are more diverse.

In general, the weights depicte for these features
make some intuitive sense (in as much as weights
for any learned algorithm make intuitive sense). It
is particularly interesting to note that while there are
some regularities to the patterns in the five diagrams,
it is definitely not the case that there are, eg., two
domains that behave identically across all features.
This supports the hypothesis that the reason our al-
gorithm works so well on this data is because the
domains are actually quite well separated.

5 Discussion

In this paper we have described an incredibly sim-
ple approach to domain adaptation that—under a
common and easy-to-verify condition—outperforms
previous approaches. While it is somewhat frus-
trating that something so simple does so well, it
is perhaps not surprising. By augmenting the fea-
ture space, we are essentially forcing the learning
algorithm to do the adaptation for us. Good super-
vised learning algorithms have been developed over
decades, and so we are essentially just leveraging all
that previous work. Our hope is that this approach
is so simple that it can be used for many more real-
world tasks than we have presented here with little
effort. Finally, it is very interesting to note that us-
ing our method, shallow parsing error rate on the

CoNLL section of the treebank improves from 5.35
to 5.11. While this improvement is small, it is real,
and may carry over to full parsing. The most impor-
tant avenue of future work is to develop a formal
framework under which we can analyze this (and
other supervised domain adaptation models) theo-
retically. Currently our results only state that this
augmentation procedure doesn’t make the learning
harder — we would like to know that it actually
makes it easier. An additional future direction is
to explore the kernelization interpretation further:
why should we use 2 as the “similarity” between
domains—we could introduce a hyperparamter α
that indicates the similarity between domains and
could be tuned via cross-validation.
