Abstract

Many automatic evaluation metrics for ma-
chine translation (MT) rely on making com-
parisons to human translations, a resource
that may not always be available. We present
a method for developing sentence-level MT
evaluation metrics that do not directly rely
on human reference translations. Our met-
rics are developed using regression learn-
ing and are based on a set of weaker indi-
cators of fluency and adequacy (pseudo ref-
erences). Experimental results suggest that
they rival standard reference-based metrics
in terms of correlations with human judg-
ments on new test instances.

1 Introduction

Automatic assessment of translation quality is a
challenging problem because the evaluation task, at
its core, is based on subjective human judgments.
Reference-based metrics such as BLEU (Papineni
et al., 2002) have rephrased this subjective task as
a somewhat more objective question: how closely
does the translation resemble sentences that are
known to be good translations for the same source?
This approach requires the participation of human
translators, who provide the “gold standard” refer-
ence sentences. However, keeping humans in the
evaluation loop represents a significant expenditure
both in terms of time and resources; therefore it is
worthwhile to explore ways of reducing the degree
of human involvement.

To this end, Gamon et al. (2005) proposed a
learning-based evaluation metric that does not com-

pare against reference translations. Under a learn-
ing framework, the input (i.e., the sentence to be
evaluated) is represented as a set of features. These
are measurements that can be extracted from the in-
put sentence (and may be individual metrics them-
selves). The learning algorithm combines the fea-
tures to form a model (a composite evaluation met-
ric) that produces the final score for the input. With-
out human references, the features in the model pro-
posed by Gamon et al. were primarily language
model features and linguistic indicators that could be
directly derived from the input sentence alone. Al-
though their initial results were not competitive with
standard reference-based metrics, their studies sug-
gested that a referenceless metric may still provide
useful information about translation fluency. How-
ever, a potential pitfall is that systems might “game
the metric” by producing fluent outputs that are not
adequate translations of the source.

This paper proposes an alternative approach to
evaluate MT outputs without comparing against hu-
man references. While our metrics are also trained,
our model consists of different features and is
trained under a different learning regime. Crucially,
our model includes features that capture some no-
tions of adequacy by comparing the input against
pseudo references: sentences from other MT sys-
tems (such as commercial off-the-shelf systems or
open sourced research systems). To improve flu-
ency judgments, the model also includes features
that compare the input against target-language “ref-
erences” such as large text corpora and treebanks.

Unlike human translations used by standard
reference-based metrics, pseudo references are not

296



“gold standards” and can be worse than the sen-
tences being evaluated; therefore, these “references”
in-and-of themselves are not necessarily informative
enough for MT evaluation. The main insight of our
approach is that through regression, the trained met-
rics can make more nuanced comparisons between
the input and pseudo references. More specifically,
our regression objective is to infer a function that
maps a feature vector (which measures an input’s
similarity to the pseudo references) to a score that
indicates the quality of the input. This is achieved by
optimizing the model’s output to correlate against a
set of training examples, which are translation sen-
tences labeled with quantitative assessments of their
quality by human judges. Although this approach
does incur some human effort, it is primarily for the
development of training data, which, ideally, can be
amortized over a long period of time.

To determine the feasibility of the proposed ap-
proach, we conducted empirical studies that com-
pare our trained metrics against standard reference-
based metrics. We report three main findings.
First, pseudo references are informative compar-
ison points. Experimental results suggest that
a regression-trained metric that compares against
pseudo references can have higher correlations with
human judgments than applying standard metrics
with multiple human references. Second, the learn-
ing model that uses both adequacy and fluency fea-
tures performed the best, with adequacy being the
more important factor. Third, when the pseudo ref-
erences are multiple MT systems, the regression-
trained metric is predictive even when the input is
from a better MT system than those providing the
references. We conjecture that comparing MT out-
puts against other imperfect translations allows for a
more nuanced discrimination of quality.

2 Background and Related Work

For a formally organized event, such as the annual
MT Evaluation sponsored by National Institute of
Standard and Technology (NIST MT Eval), it may
be worthwhile to recruit multiple human translators
to translate a few hundred sentences for evaluation
references. However, there are situations in which
multiple human references are not practically avail-
able (e.g., the source may be of a large quantity, and

no human translation exists). One such instance is
translation quality assurance, in which one wishes
to identify poor outputs in a large body of machine
translated text automatically for human to post-edit.
Another instance is in day-to-day MT research and
development, where new test set with multiple ref-
erences are also hard to come by. One could work
with previous datasets from events such as the NIST
MT Evals, but there is a danger of over-fitting. One
also could extract a single reference from parallel
corpora, although it is known that automatic metrics
are more reliable when comparing against multiple
references.

The aim of this work is to develop a trainable au-
tomatic metric for evaluation without human refer-
ences. This can be seen as a form of confidence esti-
mation on MT outputs (Blatz et al., 2003; Ueffing et
al., 2003; Quirk, 2004). The main distinction is that
confidence estimation is typically performed with a
particular system in mind, and may rely on system-
internal information in estimation. In this study, we
draw on only system-independent indicators so that
the resulting metric may be more generally applied.
This allows us to have a clearer picture of the con-
tributing factors as they interact with different types
of MT systems.

Also relevant is previous work that applied ma-
chine learning approaches to MT evaluation, both
with human references (Corston-Oliver et al., 2001;
Kulesza and Shieber, 2004; Albrecht and Hwa,
2007; Liu and Gildea, 2007) and without (Gamon et
al., 2005). One motivation for the learning approach
is the ease of combining multiple criteria. Literature
in translation evaluation reports a myriad of criteria
that people use in their judgments, but it is not clear
how these factors should be combined mathemati-
cally. Machine learning offers a principled and uni-
fied framework to induce a computational model of
human’s decision process. Disparate indicators can
be encoded as one or more input features, and the
learning algorithm tries to find a mapping from input
features to a score that quantifies the input’s quality
by optimizing the model to match human judgments
on training examples. The framework is attractive
because its objective directly captures the goal of
MT evaluation: how would a user rate the quality
of these translations?

This work differs from previous approaches in
297



two aspects. One is the representation of the model;
our model treats the metric as a distance measure
even though there are no human references. An-
other is the training of the model. More so than
when human references are available, regression is
central to the success of the approach, as it deter-
mines how much we can trust the distance measures
against each pseudo reference system.

While our model does not use human references
directly, its features are adapted from the following
distance-based metrics. The well-known BLEU (Pa-
pineni et al., 2002) is based on the number of com-
mon n-grams between the translation hypothesis and
human reference translations of the same sentence.
Metrics such as ROUGE, Head Word Chain (HWC),
METEOR, and other recently proposed methods all
offer different ways of comparing machine and hu-
man translations. ROUGE utilizes ’skip n-grams’,
which allow for matches of sequences of words that
are not necessarily adjacent (Lin and Och, 2004a).
METEOR uses the Porter stemmer and synonym-
matching via WordNet to calculate recall and pre-
cision more accurately (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005).
The HWC metrics compare dependency and con-
stituency trees for both reference and machine trans-
lations (Liu and Gildea, 2005).

3 MT Evaluation with Pseudo References
using Regression

Reference-based metrics are typically thought of as
measurements of “similarity to good translations”
because human translations are used as references,
but in more general terms, they are distance mea-
surements between two sentences. The distance be-
tween a translation hypothesis and an imperfect ref-
erence is still somewhat informative. As a toy ex-
ample, consider a one-dimensional line segment. A
distance from the end-point uniquely determines the
position of a point. When the reference location is
anywhere else on the line segment, a relative dis-
tance to the reference does not uniquely specify a
location on the line segment. However, the position
of a point can be uniquely determined if we are given
its relative distances to two reference locations.

The problem space for MT evaluation, though
more complex, is not dissimilar to the toy scenario.
There are two main differences. First, we do not

know the actual distance function – this is what we
are trying to learn. The distance functions we have
at our disposal are all heuristic approximations to the
true translational distance function. Second, unlike
human references, whose quality value is assumed to
be maximum, the quality of a pseudo reference sen-
tence is not known. In fact, prior to training, we do
not even know the quality of the reference systems.
Although the direct way to calibrate a reference sys-
tem is to evaluate its outputs, this is not practically
ideal, since human judgments would be needed each
time we wish to incorporate a new reference system.
Our proposed alternative is to calibrate the reference
systems against an existing set of human judgments
for a range of outputs from different MT systems.
That is, if many of the reference system’s outputs
are similar to those MT outputs that received low
assessments, we conclude this reference system may
not be of high quality. Thus, if a new translation is
found to be similar with this reference system’s out-
put, it is more likely for the new translation to also
be bad.

Both issues of combining evidences from heuris-
tic distances and calibrating the quality of pseudo
reference systems can be addressed by a probabilis-
tic learning model. In particular, we use regression
because its problem formulation fits naturally with
the objective of MT evaluations. In regression learn-
ing, we are interested in approximating a function f
that maps a multi-dimensional input vector, x, to a
continuous real value, y, such that the error over a set
of m training examples, {(x1, y1), . . . , (xm, ym)},
is minimized according to a loss function.

In the context of MT evaluation, y is the “true”
quantitative measure of translation quality for an in-
put sentence1. The function f represents a mathe-
matical model of human judgments of translations;
an input sentence is represented as a feature vector,
x, which contains the information that can be ex-
tracted from the input sentence (possibly including
comparisons against some reference sentences) that
are relevant to computing y. Determining the set of
relevant features for this modeling is on-going re-

1Perhaps even more so than grammaticality judgments, there
is variability in people’s judgments of translation quality. How-
ever, like grammaticality judgments, people do share some sim-
ilarities in their judgments at a coarse-grained level. Ideally,
what we refer to as the true value of translational quality should
reflect the consensus judgments of all people.

search. In this work, we consider some of the more
widely used metrics as features. Our full feature
vector consists of r × 18 adequacy features, where
r is the number of reference systems used, and 26
fluency features:

Adequacy features: These include features de-
rived from BLEU (e.g., n-gram precision, where
1 ≤ n ≤ 5, length ratios), PER, WER, fea-
tures derived from METEOR (precision, recall,
fragmentation), and ROUGE-related features (non-
consecutive bigrams with a gap size of g, where
1 ≤ g ≤ 5 and longest common subsequence).

Fluency features: We consider both string-level
features such as computing n-gram precision against
a target-language corpus as well as several syntax-
based features. We parse each input sentence into a
dependency tree and compared aspects of it against a
large target-language dependency treebank. In addi-
tion to adapting the idea of Head Word Chains (Liu
and Gildea, 2005), we also compared the input sen-
tence’s argument structures against the treebank for
certain syntactic categories.

Due to the large feature space to explore, we
chose to work with support vector regression as the
learning algorithm. As its loss function, support vec-
tor regression uses an �-insensitive error function,
which allows for errors within a margin of a small
positive value, �, to be considered as having zero er-
ror (cf. Bishop (2006), pp.339-344). Like its classi-
fication counterpart, this is a kernel-based algorithm
that finds sparse solutions so that scores for new test
instances are efficiently computed based on a subset
of the most informative training examples. In this
work, Gaussian kernels are used.

The cost of regression learning is that it requires
training examples that are manually assessed by hu-
man judges. However, compared to the cost of cre-
ating new references whenever new (test) sentences
are evaluated, the effort of creating human assess-
ment training data is a limited (ideally, one-time)
cost. Moreover, there is already a sizable collection
of human assessed data for a range of MT systems
through multiple years of the NIST MT Eval efforts.
Our experiments suggest that there is enough as-
sessed data to train the proposed regression model.

Aside from reducing the cost of developing hu-

man reference translations, the proposed metric also
provides an alternative perspective on automatic MT
evaluation that may be informative in its own right.
We conjecture that a metric that compares inputs
against a diverse population of differently imperfect
sentences may be more discriminative in judging
translation systems than solely comparing against
gold standards. That is, two sentences may be
considered equally bad from the perspective of a
gold standard, but subtle differences between them
may become more prominent if they are compared
against sentences in their peer group.

4 Experiments

We conducted experiments to determine the feasibil-
ity of the proposed approach and to address the fol-
lowing questions: (1) How informative are pseudo
references in-and-of themselves? Does varying the
number and/or the quality of the references have an
impact on the metrics? (2) What are the contribu-
tions of the adequacy features versus the fluency fea-
tures to the learning-based metric? (3) How do the
quality and distribution of the training examples, to-
gether with the quality of the pseudo references, im-
pact the metric training? (4) Do these factors impact
the metric’s ability in assessing sentences produced
within a single MT system? How does that system’s
quality affect metric performance?

4.1 Data preparation and Experimental Setup

The implementation of support vector regression
used for these experiments is SVM-Light (Joachims,
1999). We performed all experiments using the 2004
NIST Chinese MT Eval dataset. It consists of 447
source sentences that were translated by four hu-
man translators as well as ten MT systems. Each
machine translated sentence was evaluated by two
human judges for their fluency and adequacy on a
5-point scale2. To remove the bias in the distribu-
tions of scores between different judges, we follow
the normalization procedure described by Blatz et
al. (2003). The two judge’s total scores (i.e., sum
of the normalized fluency and adequacy scores) are
then averaged.

2The NIST human judges use human reference translations
when making assessments; however, our approach is generally
applicable when the judges are bilingual speakers who compare
source sentences with translation outputs.

299



We chose to work with this NIST dataset because
it contains numerous systems that span over a range
of performance levels (see Table 1 for a ranking of
the systems and their averaged human assessment
scores). This allows us to have control over the vari-
ability of the experiments while answering the ques-
tions we posed above (such as the quality of the sys-
tems providing the pseudo references, the quality of
MT systems being evaluated, and the diversity over
the distribution of training examples).

Specifically, we reserved four systems (MT2,
MT5, MT6, and MT9) for the role of pseudo ref-
erences. Sentences produced by the remaining six
systems are used as evaluative data. This set in-
cludes the best and worst systems so that we can see
how well the metrics performs on sentences that are
better (or worse) than the pseudo references. Met-
rics that require no learning are directly applied onto
all sentences of the evaluative set. For the learning-
based metrics, we perform six-fold cross validation
on the evaluative dataset. Each fold consists of sen-
tences from one MT system. In a round robin fash-
ion, each fold serves as the test set while the other
five are used for training and heldout. Thus, the
trained models have seen neither the test instances
nor other instances from the MT system that pro-
duced them.

A metric is evaluated based on its Spearman rank
correlation coefficient between the scores it gave to
the evaluative dataset and human assessments for
the same data. The correlation coefficient is a real
number between -1, indicating perfect negative cor-
relations, and +1, indicating perfect positive cor-
relations. To compare the relative quality of dif-
ferent metrics, we apply bootstrapping re-sampling
on the data, and then use paired t-test to deter-
mine the statistical significance of the correlation
differences (Koehn, 2004). For the results we re-
port, unless explicitly mentioned, all stated compar-
isons are statistically significant with 99.8% con-
fidence. We include two standard reference-based
metrics, BLEU and METEOR, as baseline compar-
isons. BLEU is smoothed (Lin and Och, 2004b), and
it considers only matching up to bigrams because
this has higher correlations with human judgments
than when higher-ordered n-grams are included.

pating systems in the NIST 2004 Chinese MT Eval-

lighted in boldface) and the data from the remaining
six for training and evaluation.

4.2 Pseudo Reference Variations vs. Metrics

We first compare different metrics’ performance
on the six-system evaluative dataset under different
configurations of human and/or pseudo references.
For the case when only one human reference is used,
the reference was chosen at random from the 2004
NIST Eval dataset3. The correlation results on the
evaluative dataset are summarized in Table 2.

Some trends are as expected: comparing within a
metric, having four references is better than having
just one; having human references is better than an
equal number of system references; having a high
quality system as reference is better than one with
low quality. Perhaps more surprising is the consis-
tent trend that metrics do significantly better with
four MT references than with one human reference,
and they do almost as well as using four human ref-
erences. The results show that pseudo references are
informative, as standard metrics were able to make
use of the pseudo references and achieve higher cor-
relations than judging from fluency alone. How-
ever, higher correlations are achieved when learning
with regression, suggesting that the trained metrics
are better at interpreting comparisons against pseudo
references.

Comparing within each reference configuration,
the regression-trained metric that includes both ad-

3One reviewer asked about the quality this human’s trans-
lations. Although we were not given official rankings of the
human references, we compared each person against the other
three using MT evaluation metrics and found this particular
translator to rank third, though the quality of all four are sig-
nificantly higher than even the best MT systems.

equacy and fluency features always has the highest
correlations. If the metric consists of only adequacy
features, its performance degrades with the decreas-
ing quality of the references. At another extreme, a
metric based only on fluency features has an over-
all correlation rate of 0.459, which is lower than
most correlations reported in Table 2. This confirms
the importance of modeling adequacy; even a sin-
gle mid-quality MT system may be an informative
pseudo reference. Finally, we note that a regression-
trained metric with the full features set that com-
pares against 4 pseudo references has a higher cor-
relation than BLEU with four human references.
These results suggest that the feedback from the hu-
man assessed training examples was able to help the
learning algorithm to combine different features to
form a better composite metric.

4.3 Sentence-Level Evaluation on Single
Systems

To explore the interaction between the quality of
the reference MT systems and that of the test MT
systems, we further study the following pseudo ref-
erence configurations: all four systems, a high-
quality system with a medium quality system, two
systems of medium-quality, one medium with one
poor system, and only the high-quality system. For
each pseudo reference configuration, we consider
three metrics: BLEU, METEOR, and the regression-
trained metric (using the full feature set). Each
metric evaluates sentences from four test systems
of varying quality: the best system in the dataset
(MT1), the worst in the set (MT10), and two mid-
ranged systems (MT4 and MT7). The correlation
coefficients are summarized in Table 3. Each row
specifies a metric/reference-type combination; each
column specifies an MT system being evaluated (us-
ing sentences from all other systems as training ex-
amples). The fluency-only metric and standard met-
rics using four human references are baselines.

The overall trends at the dataset level generally
also hold for the per-system comparisons. With the
exception of the evaluation of MT10, regression-
based metrics always has higher correlations than
standard metrics that use the same reference con-
figuration (comparing correlation coefficients within
each cell). When the best MT reference system
(MT2) is included as pseudo references, regression-

based metrics are typically better than or not statisti-
cally different from standard applications of BLEU
and METEOR with 4 human references. Using the
two mid-quality MT systems as references (MT5
and MT6), regression metrics yield correlations that
are only slightly lower than standard metrics with
human references. These results support our con-
jecture that comparing against multiple systems is
informative.

The poorer performances of the regression-based
metrics on MT10 point out an asymmetry in the
learning approach. The regression model aims to
learn a function that approximates human judgments
of translated sentences through training examples.
In the space of all possible MT outputs, the neigh-
borhood of good translations is much smaller than
that of bad translations. Thus, as long as the regres-
sion models sees some examples of sentences with
high assessment scores during training, it should
have a much better estimation of the characteristics
of good translations. This idea is supported by the
experimental data. Consider the scenario of eval-
uating MT1 while using two mid-quality MT sys-
tems as references. Although the reference systems
are not as high quality as the system under evalu-
ation, and although the training examples shown to
the regression model were also generated by systems
whose overall quality was rated lower, the trained
metric was reasonably good at ranking sentences
produced by MT1. In contrast, the task of evaluating
sentences from MT10 is more difficult for the learn-
ing approach, perhaps because it is sufficiently dif-
ferent from all training and reference systems. Cor-
relations might be improved with additional refer-
ence systems.

4.4 Discussions

The design of these experiments aims to simulate
practical situations to use our proposed metrics. For
the more frequently encountered language pairs, it
should be possible to find at least two mid-quality
(or better) MT systems to serve as pseudo refer-
ences. For example, one might use commercial off-
the-shelf systems, some of which are free over the
web. For less commonly used languages, one might
use open source research systems (Al-Onaizan et al.,
1999; Burbank et al., 2005).

highest correlations is distinguished by an asterisk (*); correlations higher than standard metrics using
human-references are highlighted in boldface; those that are statistically comparable to them are italicized.

NIST MT Evals, which contains human assessed
MT outputs for a variety of systems, can be used
for training examples. Alternatively, one might di-
rectly recruit human judges to assess sample sen-
tences from the system(s) to be evaluated. This
should result in better correlations than what we re-
ported here, since the human assessed training ex-
amples will be more similar to the test instances than
the setup in our experiments.

In developing new MT systems, pseudo refer-
ences may supplement the single human reference
translations that could be extracted from a parallel
text. Using the same setup as Exp. 1 (see Table 2),
adding pseudo references does improve correlations.

Adding four pseudo references to the single human
reference raises the correlation coefficient to 0.650
(from 0.597) for the regression metric. Adding them
to four human references results in a correlation co-
efficient of 0.660 (from 0.644)4.

5 Conclusion

In this paper, we have presented a method for de-
veloping sentence-level MT evaluation metrics with-
out using human references. We showed that by
learning from human assessed training examples,

4BLEU with four human references has a correlation of
0.628. Adding four pseudo references increases BLEU to 0.650.

302



the regression-trained metric can evaluate an input
sentence by comparing it against multiple machine-
generated pseudo references and other target lan-
guage resources. Our experimental results suggest
that the resulting metrics are robust even when the
sentences under evaluation are from a system of
higher quality than the systems serving as refer-
ences. We observe that regression metrics that use
multiple pseudo references often have comparable
or higher correlation rates with human judgments
than standard reference-based metrics. Our study
suggests that in conjunction with regression training,
multiple imperfect references may be as informative
as gold-standard references.
