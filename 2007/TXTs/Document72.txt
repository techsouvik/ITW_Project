Abstract

We introduce a simple method to pack words
for statistical word alignment. Our goal is to
simplify the task of automatic word align-
ment by packing several consecutive words
together when we believe they correspond
to a single word in the opposite language.
This is done using the word aligner itself,
i.e. by bootstrapping on its output. We
evaluate the performance of our approach
on a Chinese-to-English machine translation
task, and report a 12.2% relative increase in
BLEU score over a state-of-the art phrase-
based SMT system.

1 Introduction

Automatic word alignment can be defined as the
problem of determining a translational correspon-
dence at word level given a parallel corpus of aligned
sentences. Most current statistical models (Brown
et al., 1993; Vogel et al., 1996; Deng and Byrne,
2005) treat the aligned sentences in the corpus as se-
quences of tokens that are meant to be words; the
goal of the alignment process is to find links be-
tween source and target words. Before applying
such aligners, we thus need to segment the sentences
into words – a task which can be quite hard for lan-
guages such as Chinese for which word boundaries
are not orthographically marked. More importantly,
however, this segmentation is often performed in a
monolingual context, which makes the word align-
ment task more difficult since different languages
may realize the same concept using varying num-
bers of words (see e.g. (Wu, 1997)). Moreover, a

segmentation considered to be “good” from a mono-
lingual point of view may be unadapted for training
alignment models.

Although some statistical alignment models al-
low for 1-to-n word alignments for those reasons,
they rarely question the monolingual tokenization
and the basic unit of the alignment process remains
the word. In this paper, we focus on 1-to-n align-
ments with the goal of simplifying the task of auto-
matic word aligners by packing several consecutive
words together when we believe they correspond to a
single word in the opposite language; by identifying
enough such cases, we reduce the number of 1-to-n
alignments, thus making the task of word alignment
both easier and more natural.

Our approach consists of using the output from
an existing statistical word aligner to obtain a set of
candidates for word packing. We evaluate the re-
liability of these candidates, using simple metrics
based on co-occurence frequencies, similar to those
used in associative approaches to word alignment
(Kitamura and Matsumoto, 1996; Melamed, 2000;
Tiedemann, 2003). We then modify the segmenta-
tion of the sentences in the parallel corpus accord-
ing to this packing of words; these modified sen-
tences are then given back to the word aligner, which
produces new alignments. We evaluate the validity
of our approach by measuring the influence of the
alignment process on a Chinese-to-English Machine
Translation (MT) task.

The remainder of this paper is organized as fol-
lows. In Section 2, we study the case of 1-to-
n word alignment. Section 3 introduces an auto-
matic method to pack together groups of consecutive

Section 5, we evaluate the influence of our method
on the alignment process on a Chinese to English
MT task, and experimental results are presented.
Section 6 concludes the paper and gives avenues for
future work.

2 The Case of 1-to-n Alignment

The same concept can be expressed in different lan-
guages using varying numbers of words; for exam-
ple, a single Chinese word may surface as a com-
pound or a collocation in English. This is fre-
quent for languages as different as Chinese and En-
glish. To quickly (and approximately) evaluate this
phenomenon, we trained the statistical IBM word-
alignment model 4 (Brown et al., 1993),1 using the
GIZA++ software (Och and Ney, 2003) for the fol-
lowing language pairs: Chinese–English, Italian–
English, and Dutch–English, using the IWSLT-2006
corpus (Takezawa et al., 2002; Paul, 2006) for the
first two language pairs, and the Europarl corpus
(Koehn, 2005) for the last one. These asymmet-
ric models produce 1-to-n alignments, with n ≥ 0,
in both directions. Here, it is important to mention
that the segmentation of sentences is performed to-
tally independently of the bilingual alignment pro-
cess, i.e. it is done in a monolingual context. For Eu-
ropean languages, we apply the maximum-entropy
based tokenizer of OpenNLP2; the Chinese sen-
tences were human segmented (Paul, 2006).

In Table 1, we report the frequencies of the dif-
ferent types of alignments for the various languages
and directions. As expected, the number of 1:n

1More specifically, we performed 5 iterations of Model 1, 5
iterations of HMM, 5 iterations of Model 3, and 5 iterations of
Model 4.

alignments with n 6= 1 is high for Chinese–English
(' 40%), and significantly higher than for the Eu-
ropean languages. The case of 1-to-n alignments is,
therefore, obviously an important issue when deal-
ing with Chinese–English word alignment.3

2.1 The Treatment of 1-to-n Alignments

Fertility-based models such as IBM models 3, 4, and
5 allow for alignments between one word and sev-
eral words (1-to-n or 1:n alignments in what fol-
lows), in particular for the reasons specified above.
They can be seen as extensions of the simpler IBM
models 1 and 2 (Brown et al., 1993). Similarly,
Deng and Byrne (2005) propose an HMM frame-
work capable of dealing with 1-to-n alignment,
which is an extension of the original model of (Vogel
et al., 1996).

However, these models rarely question the mono-
lingual tokenization, i.e. the basic unit of the align-
ment process is the word.4 One alternative to ex-
tending the expressivity of one model (and usually
its complexity) is to focus on the input representa-
tion; in particular, we argue that the alignment pro-
cess can benefit from a simplification of the input,
which consists of trying to reduce the number of
1-to-n alignments to consider. Note that the need
to consider segmentation and alignment at the same
time is also mentioned in (Tiedemann, 2003), and
related issues are reported in (Wu, 1997).

2.2 Notation

While in this paper, we focus on Chinese–English,
the method proposed is applicable to any language

3Note that a 1: 0 alignment may denote a failure to capture
a 1: n alignment with n > 1.

4Interestingly, this is actually even the case for approaches
that directly model alignments between phrases (Marcu and
Wong, 2002; Birch et al., 2006).

pair – even for closely related languages, we ex-
pect improvements to be seen. The notation how-
ever assume Chinese–English MT. Given a Chi-
nese sentence cJ1 consisting of J words {c1, . . . , cJ}
and an English sentence eI1 consisting of I words
{e1, . . . , eI}, AC→E (resp. AE→C) will denote a
Chinese-to-English (resp. an English-to-Chinese)
word alignment between cJ1 and e

I
1. Since we are

primarily interested in 1-to-n alignments, AC→E
can be represented as a set of pairs aj = 〈cj , Ej〉
denoting a link between one single Chinese word
cj and a few English words Ej (and similarly for
AE→C). The set Ej is empty if the word cj is not
aligned to any word in eI1.

3 Automatic Word Repacking

Our approach consists of packing consecutive words
together when we believe they correspond to a sin-
gle word in the other language. This bilingually
motivated packing of words changes the basic unit
of the alignment process, and simplifies the task of
automatic word alignment. We thus minimize the
number of 1-to-n alignments in order to obtain more
comparable segmentations in the two languages. In
this section, we present an automatic method that
builds upon the output from an existing automatic
word aligner. More specifically, we (i) use a word
aligner to obtain 1-to-n alignments, (ii) extract can-
didates for word packing, (iii) estimate the reliability
of these candidates, (iv) replace the groups of words
to pack by a single token in the parallel corpus, and
(v) re-iterate the alignment process using the up-
dated corpus. The first three steps are performed
in both directions, and produce two bilingual dic-
tionaries (source-target and target-source) of groups
of words to pack.

3.1 Candidate Extraction

In the following, we assume the availability of an
automatic word aligner that can output alignments
AC→E and AE→C for any sentence pair (cJ1 , e

I
1)

in a parallel corpus. We also assume that AC→E
and AE→C contain 1:n alignments. Our method for
repacking words is very simple: whenever a single
word is aligned with several consecutive words, they
are considered candidates for repacking. Formally,
given an alignment AC→E between c

J
1 and e

I
1, if

aj = 〈cj , Ej〉 ∈ AC→E , with Ej = {ej1 , . . . , ejm}
and ∀k ∈ J1,m− 1K, jk+1 − jk = 1, then the align-
ment aj between cj and the sequence of words Ej
is considered a candidate for word repacking. The
same goes for AE→C . Some examples of such 1-
to-n alignments between Chinese and English (in
both directions) we can derive automatically are dis-
played in Figure 1.

3.2 Candidate Reliability Estimation

Of course, the process described above is error-
prone and if we want to change the input to give to
the word aligner, we need to make sure that we are
not making harmful modifications.5 We thus addi-
tionally evaluate the reliability of the candidates we
extract and filter them before inclusion in our bilin-
gual dictionary. To perform this filtering, we use
two simple statistical measures. In the following,
aj = 〈cj , Ej〉 denotes a candidate.

The first measure we consider is co-occurrence
frequency (COOC(cj , Ej)), i.e. the number of
times cj and Ej co-occur in the bilingual corpus.
This very simple measure is frequently used in as-
sociative approaches (Melamed, 1997; Tiedemann,
2003). The second measure is the alignment confi-
dence, defined as

AC(aj) =
C(aj)

COOC(cj , Ej)
,

where C(aj) denotes the number of alignments pro-
posed by the word aligner that are identical to aj .
In other words, AC(aj) measures how often the

5Consequently, if we compare our approach to the problem
of collocation identification, we may say that we are more in-
terested in precision than recall (Smadja et al., 1996). However,
note that our goal is not recognizing specific sequences of words
such as compounds or collocations; it is making (bilingually
motivated) changes that simplify the alignment process.

306



aligner aligns cj and Ej when they co-occur. We
also impose that |Ej | ≤ k, where k is a fixed inte-
ger that may depend on the language pair (between
3 and 5 in practice). The rationale behind this is that
it is very rare to get reliable alignment between one
word and k consecutive words when k is high.

The candidates are included in our bilingual dic-
tionary if and only if their measures are above some
fixed thresholds tcooc and tac, which allow for the
control of the size of the dictionary and the quality
of its contents. Some other measures (including the
Dice coefficient) could be considered; however, it
has to be noted that we are more interested here in
the filtering than in the discovery of alignment, since
our method builds upon an existing aligner. More-
over, we will see that even these simple measures
can lead to an improvement of the alignment pro-
cess in a MT context (cf. Section 5).

3.3 Bootstrapped Word Repacking

Once the candidates are extracted, we repack the
words in the bilingual dictionaries constructed using
the method described above; this provides us with
an updated training corpus, in which some word se-
quences have been replaced by a single token. This
update is totally naive: if an entry aj = 〈cj , Ej〉 is
present in the dictionary and matches one sentence
pair (cJ1 , e

I
1) (i.e. cj and Ej are respectively con-

tained in cJ1 and e
I
1), then we replace the sequence

of words Ej with a single token which becomes a
new lexical unit.6 Note that this replacement occurs
even if no alignment was found between cj and Ej
for the pair (cJ1 , e

I
1). This is motivated by the fact

that the filtering described above is quite conserva-
tive; we trust the entry ai to be correct. This update
is performed in both directions. It is then possible to
run the word aligner using the updated (simplified)
parallel corpus, in order to get new alignments. By
performing a deterministic word packing, we avoid
the computation of the fertility parameters associ-
ated with fertility-based models.

Word packing can be applied several times: once
we have grouped some words together, they become
the new basic unit to consider, and we can re-run
the same method to get additional groupings. How-

place, we select the one with highest confidence (according to
tac).

ever, we have not seen in practice much benefit from
running it more than twice (few new candidates are
extracted after two iterations).

It is also important to note that this process is
bilingually motivated and strongly depends on the
language pair. For example, white wine, excuse me,
call the police, and cup of (cf. Figure 1) translate re-
spectively as vin blanc, excusez-moi, appellez la po-
lice, and tasse de in French. Those groupings would
not be found for a language pair such as French–
English, which is consistent with the fact that they
are less useful for French–English than for Chinese–
English in a MT perspective.

3.4 Using Manually Developed Dictionaries

We wanted to compare this automatic approach to
manually developed resources. For this purpose,
we used a dictionary built by the MT group of
Harbin Institute of Technology, as a preprocessing
step to Chinese–English word alignment, and moti-
vated by several years of Chinese–English MT prac-
tice. Some examples extracted from this resource
are displayed in Figure 2.

4 Experimental Setting

4.1 Evaluation

The intrinsic quality of word alignment can be as-
sessed using the Alignment Error Rate (AER) met-
ric (Och and Ney, 2003), that compares a system’s
alignment output to a set of gold-standard align-
ment. While this method gives a direct evaluation of
the quality of word alignment, it is faced with sev-
eral limitations. First, it is really difficult to build
a reliable and objective gold-standard set, especially
for languages as different as Chinese and English.
Second, an increase in AER does not necessarily im-
ply an improvement in translation quality (Liang et
al., 2006) and vice-versa (Vilar et al., 2006). The

307



relationship between word alignments and their im-
pact on MT is also investigated in (Ayan and Dorr,
2006; Lopez and Resnik, 2006; Fraser and Marcu,
2006). Consequently, we chose to extrinsically eval-
uate the performance of our approach via the transla-
tion task, i.e. we measure the influence of the align-
ment process on the final translation output. The
quality of the translation output is evaluated using
BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002).

4.2 Data

The experiments were carried out using the
Chinese–English datasets provided within the
IWSLT 2006 evaluation campaign (Paul, 2006), ex-
tracted from the Basic Travel Expression Corpus
(BTEC) (Takezawa et al., 2002). This multilingual
speech corpus contains sentences similar to those
that are usually found in phrase-books for tourists
going abroad. Training was performed using the de-
fault training set, to which we added the sets de-
vset1, devset2, and devset3.7 The English side of
the test set was not available at the time we con-
ducted our experiments, so we split the development
set (devset 4) into two parts: one was kept for testing
(200 aligned sentences) with the rest (289 aligned
sentences) used for development purposes.

As a pre-processing step, the English sentences
were tokenized using the maximum-entropy based
tokenizer of the OpenNLP toolkit, and case infor-
mation was removed. For Chinese, the data pro-
vided were tokenized according to the output format
of ASR systems, and human-corrected (Paul, 2006).
Since segmentations are human-corrected, we are
sure that they are good from a monolingual point of
view. Table 2 contains the various corpus statistics.

4.3 Baseline

We use a standard log-linear phrase-based statistical
machine translation system as a baseline: GIZA++
implementation of IBM word alignment model 4
(Brown et al., 1993; Och and Ney, 2003),8 the re-
finement and phrase-extraction heuristics described
in (Koehn et al., 2003), minimum-error-rate training

7More specifically, we choose the first English reference
from the 7 references and the Chinese sentence to construct new
sentence pairs.

8Training is performed using the same number of iterations
as in Section 2.

ing trained with SRILM (Stolcke, 2002) on the En-
glish side of the training data and Pharaoh (Koehn,
2004) with default settings to decode. The log-linear
model is also based on standard features: condi-
tional probabilities and lexical smoothing of phrases
in both directions, and phrase penalty (Zens and
Ney, 2004).

5 Experimental Results

5.1 Results

The initial word alignments are obtained using the
baseline configuration described above. From these,
we build two bilingual 1-to-n dictionaries (one for
each direction), and the training corpus is updated
by repacking the words in the dictionaries, using the
method presented in Section 2. As previously men-
tioned, this process can be repeated several times; at
each step, we can also choose to exploit only one of
the two available dictionaries, if so desired. We then
extract aligned phrases using the same procedure as
for the baseline system; the only difference is the ba-
sic unit we are considering. Once the phrases are ex-
tracted, we perform the estimation of the features of
the log-linear model and unpack the grouped words
to recover the initial words. Finally, minimum-error-
rate training and decoding are performed.

The various parameters of the method (k, tcooc,
tac, cf. Section 2) have been optimized on the devel-
opment set. We found out that it was enough to per-
form two iterations of repacking: the optimal set of
values was found to be k = 3, tac = 0.5, tcooc = 20
for the first iteration, and tcooc = 10 for the second

iteration, for both directions.9 In Table 3, we report
the results obtained on the test set, where n denotes
the iteration. We first considered the inclusion of
only the Chinese–English dictionary, then only the
English–Chinese dictionary, and then both.

After the first step, we can already see an im-
provement over the baseline when considering one
of the two dictionaries. When using both, we ob-
serve an increase of 1.45 BLEU points, which cor-
responds to a 9.6% relative increase. Moreover, we
can gain from performing another step. However,
the inclusion of the English–Chinese dictionary is
harmful in this case, probably because 1-to-n align-
ments are less frequent for this direction, and have
been captured during the first step. By including the
Chinese–English dictionary only, we can achieve an
increase of 1.85 absolute BLEU points (12.2% rela-
tive) over the initial baseline.10

Quality of the Dictionaries To assess the qual-
ity of the extraction procedure, we simply manu-
ally evaluated the ratio of incorrect entries in the
dictionaries. After one step of word packing, the
Chinese–English and the English–Chinese dictio-
naries respectively contain 7.4% and 13.5% incor-
rect entries. After two steps of packing, they only
contain 5.9% and 10.3% incorrect entries.

5.2 Alignment Types

Intuitively, the word alignments obtained after word
packing are more likely to be 1-to-1 than before. In-

9The parameters k, tac, and tcooc are optimized for each
step, and the alignment obtained using the best set of parameters
for a given step are used as input for the following step.

10Note that this setting (using both dictionaries for the first
step and only the Chinese dictionary for the second step) is also
the best setting on the development set.

deed, the word sequences in one language that usu-
ally align to one single word in the other language
have been grouped together to form one single to-
ken. Table 4 shows the detail of the distribution of
alignment types after one and two steps of automatic
repacking. In particular, we can observe that the 1: 1

1: 0 1: 1 1: 2 1: 3 1:n

n=2 25.10 62.73 9.38 1.68 1.12

Table 4: Distribution of alignment types (%)

alignments are more frequent after the application
of repacking: the ratio of this type of alignment has
increased by 7.81% for Chinese–English and 5.26%
for English–Chinese.

5.3 Influence of Word Segmentation

To test the influence of the initial word segmenta-
tion on the process of word packing, we considered
an additional segmentation configuration, based on
an automatic segmenter combining rule-based and
statistical techniques (Zhao et al., 2001).

BLEU[%]
Original segmentation 15.14
Original segmentation + Word packing 16.99
Automatic segmentation 14.91
Automatic segmentation + Word packing 17.51

Table 5: Influence of Chinese segmentation

The results obtained are displayed in Table 5. As
expected, the automatic segmenter leads to slightly
lower results than the human-corrected segmenta-
tion. However, the proposed method seems to be
beneficial irrespective of the choice of segmentation.
Indeed, we can also observe an improvement in the
new setting: 2.6 points absolute increase in BLEU
(17.4% relative).11

11We could actually consider an extreme case, which would
consist of splitting the sentences into characters, i.e. each char-
acter would be blindly treated as one word. The segmentation

5.4 Exploiting Manually Developed Resources

We also compared our technique for automatic pack-
ing of words with the exploitation of manually
developed resources. More specifically, we used
a 1-to-n Chinese–English bilingual dictionary, de-
scribed in Section 3.4, and used it in place of the
automatically acquired dictionary. Words are thus
grouped according to this dictionary, and we then
apply the same word aligner as for previous experi-
ments. In this case, since we are not bootstrapping
from the output of a word aligner, this can actually
be seen as a pre-processing step prior to alignment.
These resources follow more or less the same for-
mat as the output of the word segmenter mentioned
in Section 5.1.2 (Zhao et al., 2001), so the experi-
ments are carried out using this segmentation.

BLEU[%]
Baseline 14.91
Automatic word packing 17.51
Packing with “manual” dictionary 16.15

Table 6: Exploiting manually developed resources

The results obtained are displayed in Table 6.We
can observe that the use of the manually developed
dictionary provides us with an improvement in trans-
lation quality: 1.24 BLEU points absolute (8.3% rel-
ative). However, there does not seem to be a clear
gain when compared with the automatic method.
Even if those manual resources were extended, we
do not believe the improvement is sufficient enough
to justify this additional effort.

6 Conclusion and Future Work

In this paper, we have introduced a simple yet effec-
tive method to pack words together in order to give
a different and simplified input to automatic word
aligners. We use a bootstrap approach in which we
first extract 1-to-n word alignments using an exist-
ing word aligner, and then estimate the confidence
of those alignments to decide whether or not the n
words have to be grouped; if so, this group is con-

would thus be completely driven by the bilingual alignment pro-
cess (see also (Wu, 1997; Tiedemann, 2003) for related consid-
erations). In this case, our approach would be similar to the
approach of (Xu et al., 2004), except for the estimation of can-
didates.

sidered a new basic unit to consider. We can finally
re-apply the word aligner to the updated sentences.

We have evaluated the performance of our ap-
proach by measuring the influence of this process
on a Chinese-to-English MT task, based on the
IWSLT 2006 evaluation campaign. We report a
12.2% relative increase in BLEU score over a stan-
dard phrase-based SMT system. We have verified
that this process actually reduces the number of 1:n
alignments with n 6= 1, and that it is rather indepen-
dent from the (Chinese) segmentation strategy.

As for future work, we first plan to consider dif-
ferent confidence measures for the filtering of the
alignment candidates. We also want to bootstrap on
different word aligners; in particular, one possibility
is to use the flexible HMM word-to-phrase model of
Deng and Byrne (2005) in place of IBM model 4.
Finally, we would like to apply this method to other
corpora and language pairs.
