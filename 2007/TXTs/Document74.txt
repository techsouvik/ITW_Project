Abstract
We investigate the factors which determine
constituent order in German clauses and pro-
pose an algorithm which performs the task
in two steps: First, the best candidate for
the initial sentence position is chosen. Then,
the order for the remaining constituents is
determined. The first task is more difficult
than the second one because of properties
of the German sentence-initial position. Ex-
periments show a significant improvement
over competing approaches. Our algorithm
is also more efficient than these.

1 Introduction

Many natural languages allow variation in the word
order. This is a challenge for natural language gen-
eration and machine translation systems, or for text
summarizers. E.g., in text-to-text generation (Barzi-
lay & McKeown, 2005; Marsi & Krahmer, 2005;
Wan et al., 2005), new sentences are fused from de-
pendency structures of input sentences. The last step
of sentence fusion is linearization of the resulting
parse. Even for English, which is a language with
fixed word order, this is not a trivial task.

German has a relatively free word order. This
concerns the order of constituents1 within sentences
while the order of words within constituents is rela-
tively rigid. The grammar only partially prescribes
how constituents dependent on the verb should be
ordered, and for many clauses each of the n! possi-
ble permutations of n constituents is grammatical.

1Henceforth, we will use this term to refer to constituents
dependent on the clausal top node, i.e. a verb, only.

In spite of the permanent interest in German word
order in the linguistics community, most studies
have limited their scope to the order of verb argu-
ments and few researchers have implemented – and
even less evaluated – a generation algorithm. In this
paper, we present an algorithm, which orders not
only verb arguments but all kinds of constituents,
and evaluate it on a corpus of biographies. For
each parsed sentence in the test set, our maximum-
entropy-based algorithm aims at reproducing the or-
der found in the original text. We investigate the
importance of different linguistic factors and sug-
gest an algorithm to constituent ordering which first
determines the sentence initial constituent and then
orders the remaining ones. We provide evidence
that the task requires language-specific knowledge
to achieve better results and point to the most diffi-
cult part of it. Similar to Langkilde & Knight (1998)
we utilize statistical methods. Unlike overgenera-
tion approaches (Varges & Mellish, 2001, inter alia)
which select the best of all possible outputs ours is
more efficient, because we do not need to generate
every permutation.

2 Theoretical Premises

2.1 Background

It has been suggested that several factors have an in-
fluence on German constituent order. Apart from
the constraints posed by the grammar, information
structure, surface form, and discourse status have
also been shown to play a role. It has also been
observed that there are preferences for a particular
order. The preferences summarized below have mo-

320



tivated our choice of features:

• constituents in the nominative case precede
those in other cases, and dative constituents
often precede those in the accusative case
(Uszkoreit, 1987; Keller, 2000);

• the verb arguments’ order depends on the
verb’s subcategorization properties (Kurz,
2000);

• constituents with a definite article precede
those with an indefinite one (Weber & Müller,
2004);

• pronominalized constituents precede non-
pronominalized ones (Kempen & Harbusch,
2004);

• animate referents precede inanimate ones (Pap-
pert et al., 2007);

• short constituents precede longer ones (Kim-
ball, 1973);

• the preferred topic position is right after the
verb (Frey, 2004);

• the initial position is usually occupied by
scene-setting elements and topics (Speyer,
2005).

• there is a default order based on semantic prop-
erties of constituents (Sgall et al., 1986):
Actor < Temporal < SpaceLocative < Means < Ad-

dressee < Patient < Source < Destination < Purpose

Note that most of these preferences were identified
in corpus studies and experiments with native speak-
ers and concern the order of verb arguments only.
Little has been said so far about how non-arguments
should be ordered.

German is a verb second language, i.e., the po-
sition of the verb in the main clause is determined
exclusively by the grammar and is insensitive to
other factors. Thus, the German main clause is di-
vided into two parts by the finite verb: Vorfeld (VF),
which contains exactly one constituent, and Mit-
telfeld (MF), where the remaining constituents are
located. The subordinate clause normally has only
MF. The VF and MF are marked with brackets in
Example 1:

’Apart from that, Lummer developed a
Mercury-vapor lamp to produce monochrome
light’.

2.2 Our Hypothesis

The essential contribution of our study is that we
treat preverbal and postverbal parts of the sentence
differently. The sentence-initial position, which in
German is the VF, has been shown to be cognitively
more prominent than other positions (Gernsbacher
& Hargreaves, 1988). Motivated by the theoretical
work by Chafe (1976) and Jacobs (2001), we view
the VF as the place for elements which modify the
situation described in the sentence, i.e. for so called
frame-setting topics (Jacobs, 2001). For example,
temporal or locational constituents, or anaphoric ad-
verbs are good candidates for the VF. We hypoth-
esize that the reasons which bring a constituent to
the VF are different from those which place it, say,
to the beginning of the MF, for the order in the MF
has been shown to be relatively rigid (Keller, 2000;
Kempen & Harbusch, 2004). Speakers have the
freedom of selecting the outgoing point for a sen-
tence. Once they have selected it, the remaining con-
stituents are arranged in the MF, mainly according to
their grammatical properties.

This last observation motivates another hypothe-
sis we make: The cumulation of the properties of
a constituent determines its salience. This salience
can be calculated and used for ordering with a sim-
ple rule stating that more salient constituents should
precede less salient ones. In this case there is no
need to generate all possible orders and rank them.
The best order can be obtained from a random one
by sorting. Our experiments support this view. A
two-step approach, which first selects the best can-
didate for the VF and then arranges the remaining
constituents in the MF with respect to their salience
performs better than algorithms which generate the
order for a sentence as a whole.

3 Related Work

Uszkoreit (1987) addresses the problem from a
mostly grammar-based perspective and suggests
weighted constraints, such as [+NOM] ≺ [+DAT],
[+PRO] ≺ [–PRO], [–FOCUS] ≺ [+FOCUS], etc.

Kruijff et al. (2001) describe an architecture
which supports generating the appropriate word or-
der for different languages. Inspired by the findings
of the Prague School (Sgall et al., 1986) and Sys-
temic Functional Linguistics (Halliday, 1985), they
focus on the role that information structure plays
in constituent ordering. Kruijff-Korbayová et al.
(2002) address the task of word order generation in
the same vein. Similar to ours, their algorithm rec-
ognizes the special role of the sentence-initial po-
sition which they reserve for the theme – the point
of departure of the message. Unfortunately, they did
not implement their algorithm, and it is hard to judge
how well the system would perform on real data.

Harbusch et al. (2006) present a generation work-
bench, which has the goal of producing not the most
appropriate order, but all grammatical ones. They
also do not provide experimental results.

The work of Uchimoto et al. (2000) is done on
the free word order language Japanese. They de-
termine the order of phrasal units dependent on the
same modifiee. Their approach is similar to ours in
that they aim at regenerating the original order from
a dependency parse, but differs in the scope of the
problem as they regenerate the order of modifers for
all and not only for the top clausal node. Using a
maximum entropy framework, they choose the most
probable order from the set of all permutations of n
words by the following formula:

P (1|h) = P ({Wi,i+j = 1|1 ≤ i ≤ n− 1, 1 ≤ j ≤ n− i}|h)

is 1 if word wi precedes wi+j in the reference sen-
tence, 0 otherwise. The features they use are akin
to those which play a role in determining German
word order. We use their approach as a non-trivial
baseline in our study.

Ringger et al. (2004) aim at regenerating the or-
der of constituents as well as the order within them
for German and French technical manuals. Utilizing
syntactic, semantic, sub-categorization and length
features, they test several statistical models to find
the order which maximizes the probability of an or-
dered tree. Using “Markov grammars” as the start-
ing point and conditioning on the syntactic category
only, they expand a non-terminal node C by predict-
ing its daughters from left to right:

P (C|h) =
n

Y

i=1

P (di|di−1, ..., di−j , c, h) (2)

Here, c is the syntactic category of C, d and h
are the syntactic categories of C’s daughters and the
daughter which is the head of C respectively.

In their simplest system, whose performance is
only 2.5% worse than the performance of the best
one, they condition on both syntactic categories and
semantic relations (ψ) according to the formula:

P (C|h) =

n
Y

i=1

»

P (ψi|di−1, ψi−1, ...di−j , ψi−j , c, h)
×P (di|ψi, di−1, ψi−1..., di−j , ψi−j , c, h)

–

(3)

Although they test their system on German data,
it is hard to compare their results to ours directly.
First, the metric they use does not describe the per-
formance appropriately (see Section 6.1). Second,
while the word order within NPs and PPs as well as
the verb position are prescribed by the grammar to a
large extent, the constituents can theoretically be or-
dered in any way. Thus, by generating the order for
every non-terminal node, they combine two tasks of
different complexity and mix the results of the more
difficult task with those of the easier one.

4 Data

The data we work with is a collection of biogra-
phies from the German version of Wikipedia3. Fully
automatic preprocessing in our system comprises
the following steps: First, a list of people of a
certain Wikipedia category is taken and an article
is extracted for every person. Second, sentence

boundaries are identified with a Perl CPAN mod-
ule4 whose performance we improved by extend-
ing the list of abbreviations. Next, the sentences
are split into tokens. The TnT tagger (Brants, 2000)
and the TreeTagger (Schmid, 1997) are used for tag-
ging and lemmatization. Finally, the articles are
parsed with the CDG dependency parser (Foth &
Menzel, 2006). Named entities are classified accord-
ing to their semantic type using lists and category
information from Wikipedia: person (pers), location
(loc), organization (org), or undefined named entity
(undef ne). Temporal expressions (Oktober 1915,
danach (after that) etc.) are identified automatically
by a set of patterns. Inevitable during automatic an-
notation, errors at one of the preprocessing stages
cause errors at the ordering stage.

Distinguishing between main and subordinate
clauses, we split the total of about 19 000 sentences
into training, development and test sets (Table 1).
Clauses with one constituent are sorted out as trivial.
The distribution of both types of clauses according
to their length in constituents is given in Table 2.

Given the sentence in Example 1, we first trans-
form its dependency parse into a more general
representation (Figure 15) and then, based on the
predictions of our learner, arrange the four con-
stituents. For evaluation, we compare the arranged
order against the original one.

Note that we predict neither the position of the
verb, nor the order within constituents as the former
is explicitly determined by the grammar, and the lat-
ter is much more rigid than the order of constituents.

5 Baselines and Algorithms

We compare the performance of two our algorithms
with four baselines.

5.1 Random
We improve a trivial random baseline (RAND) by
two syntax-oriented rules: the first position is re-
served for the subject and the second for the direct
object if there is any; the order of the remaining con-
stituents is generated randomly (RAND IMP).

5.2 Statistical Bigram Model
Similar to Ringger et al. (2004), we find the order
with the highest probability conditioned on syntac-
tic and semantic categories. Unlike them we use de-
pendency parses and compute the probability of the
top node only, which is modified by all constituents.
With these adjustments the probability of an order
O given the history h, if conditioned on syntactic
functions of constituents (s1...sn), is simply:

P (O|h) =
n∏

i=1

P (si|si−1, h) (4)

Ringger et al. (2004) do not make explicit, what
their set of semantic relations consists of. From the

5OBJA stands for the accusative object.

323



example in the paper, it seems that these are a mix-
ture of lexical and syntactic information6. Our anno-
tation does not specify semantic relations. Instead,
some of the constituents are categorized as pers, loc,
temp, org or undef ne if their heads bear one of these
labels. By joining these with possible syntactic func-
tions, we obtain a larger set of syntactic-semantic
tags as, e.g., subj-pers, pp-loc, adv-temp. We trans-
form each clause in the training set into a sequence
of such tags, plus three tags for the verb position (v),
the beginning (b) and the end (e) of the clause. Then
we compute the bigram probabilities7.

For our third baseline (BIGRAM), we select from
all possible orders the one with the highest probabil-
ity as calculated by the following formula:

P (O|h) =
n∏

i=1

P (ti|ti−1, h) (5)

where ti is from the set of joined tags. For Example
1, possible tag sequences (i.e. orders) are ’b subj-
pers v adv obja sub e’, ’b adv v subj-pers obja sub
e’, ’b obja v adv sub subj-pers e’, etc.

5.3 Uchimoto

For the fourth baseline (UCHIMOTO), we utilized a
maximum entropy learner (OpenNLP8) and reim-
plemented the algorithm of Uchimoto et al. (2000).
For every possible permutation, its probability is es-
timated according to Formula (1). The binary clas-
sifier, whose task was to predict the probability that
the order of a pair of constituents is correct, was
trained on the following features describing the verb
or hc – the head of a constituent c9:

vlex, vpass, vmod the lemma of the root of the
clause (non-auxiliary verb), the voice of the
verb and the number of constituents to order;

lex the lemma of hc or, if hc is a functional word,
the lemma of the word which depends on it;

pos part-of-speech tag of hc;
6E.g. DefDet, Coords, Possr, werden
7We use the CMU Toolkit (Clarkson & Rosenfeld, 1997).
8http://opennlp.sourceforge.net
9We disregarded features which use information specific to

Japanese and non-applicable to German (e.g. on postpositional
particles).

sem if defined, the semantic class of c; e.g. im April
1900 and mit Albert Einstein (with Albert Ein-
stein) are classified temp and pers respectively;

syn, same the syntactic function of hc and whether
it is the same for the two constituents;

mod number of modifiers of hc;

rep whether hc appears in the preceding sentence;

pro whether c contains a (anaphoric) pronoun.

5.4 Maximum Entropy
The first configuration of our system is an extended
version of the UCHIMOTO baseline (MAXENT). To
the features describing c we added the following
ones:

det the kind of determiner modifying hc (def, indef,
non-appl);

rel whether hc is modified by a relative clause (yes,
no, non-appl);

dep the depth of c;

len the length of c in words.

The first two features describe the discourse status
of a constituent; the other two provide information
on its “weight”. Since our learner treats all values
as nominal, we discretized the values of dep and len
with a C4.5 classifier (Kohavi & Sahami, 1996).

Another modification concerns the efficiency of
the algorithm. Instead of calculating probabilities
for all pairs, we obtain the right order from a random
one by sorting. We compare adjacent elements by
consulting the learner as if we would sort an array of
numbers. Given two adjacent constituents, ci < cj ,
we check the probability of their being in the right
order, i.e. that ci precedes cj : Ppre(ci, cj). If it is
less than 0.5, we transpose the two and compare ci
with the next one.

Since the sorting method presupposes that the pre-
dicted relation is transitive, we checked whether this
is really so on the development and test data sets. We
looked for three constituents ci, cj , ck from a sen-
tence S, such that Ppre(ci, cj) > 0.5, Ppre(cj , ck) >
0.5, Ppre(ci, ck) < 0.5 and found none. Therefore,
unlike UCHIMOTO, where one needs to make exactly
N ! ∗ N(N − 1)/2 comparisons, we have to make
N(N − 1)/2 comparisons at most.

324



5.5 The Two-Step Approach
The main difference between our first algorithm
(MAXENT) and the second one (TWO-STEP) is that
we generate the order in two steps10 (both classifiers
are trained on the same features):

1. For the VF, using the OpenNLP maximum en-
tropy learner for a binary classification (VF vs.
MF), we select the constituent c with the high-
est probability of being in the VF.

2. For the MF, the remaining constituents are put
into a random order and then sorted the way it
is done for MAXENT. The training data for the
second task was generated only from the MF of
clauses.

6 Results

6.1 Evaluation Metrics
We use several metrics to evaluate our systems and
the baselines. The first is per-sentence accuracy
(acc) which is the proportion of correctly regener-
ated sentences. Kendall’s τ , which has been used for
evaluating sentence ordering tasks (Lapata, 2006),
is the second metric we use. τ is calculated as
1− 4 t

N(N−1)
, where t is the number of interchanges

of consecutive elements to arrange N elements in
the right order. τ is sensitive to near misses and
assigns abdc (almost correct order) a score of 0.66
while dcba (inverse order) gets −1. Note that it is
questionable whether this metric is as appropriate
for word ordering tasks as for sentence ordering ones
because a near miss might turn out to be ungrammat-
ical whereas a more different order stays acceptable.

Apart from acc and τ , we also adopt the metrics
used by Uchimoto et al. (2000) and Ringger et al.
(2004). The former use agreement rate (agr) cal-
culated as 2p

N(N−1)
: the number of correctly ordered

pairs of constituents over the total number of all pos-
sible pairs, as well as complete agreement which is
basically per-sentence accuracy. Unlike τ , which
has −1 as the lowest score, agr ranges from 0 to 1.
Ringger et al. (2004) evaluate the performance only
in terms of per-constituent edit distance calculated
as m

N
, where m is the minimum number of moves11

10Since subordinate clauses do not have a VF, the first step is
not needed.

11A move is a deletion combined with an insertion.

needed to arrange N constituents in the right order.
This measure seems less appropriate than τ or agr
because it does not take the distance of the move into
account and scores abced and eabcd equally (0.2).

Since τ and agr, unlike edit distance, give higher
scores to better orders, we compute inverse distance:
inv = 1 – edit distance instead. Thus, all three met-
rics (τ , agr, inv) give the maximum of 1 if con-
stituents are ordered correctly. However, like τ , agr
and inv can give a positive score to an ungrammat-
ical order. Hence, none of the evaluation metrics
describes the performance perfectly. Human eval-
uation which reliably distinguishes between appro-
priate, acceptable, grammatical and ingrammatical
orders was out of choice because of its high cost.

6.2 Results

The results on the test data are presented in Table
3. The performance of TWO-STEP is significantly
better than any other method (χ2, p < 0.01). The
performance of MAXENT does not significantly dif-
fer from UCHIMOTO. BIGRAM performed about as
good as UCHIMOTO and MAXENT. We also checked
how well TWO-STEP performs on each of the two
sub-tasks (Table 4) and found that the VF selection
is considerably more difficult than the sorting part.

acc τ agr inv
RAND 15% 0.02 0.51 0.64
RAND IMP 23% 0.24 0.62 0.71
BIGRAM 51% 0.60 0.80 0.83
UCHIMOTO 50% 0.65 0.82 0.83
MAXENT 52% 0.67 0.84 0.84
TWO-STEP 61% 0.72 0.86 0.87

Table 3: Per-clause mean of the results

The most important conclusion we draw from the
results is that the gain of 9% accuracy is due to the
VF selection only, because the feature sets are iden-
tical for MAXENT and TWO-STEP. From this fol-
lows that doing feature selection without splitting
the task in two is ineffective, because the importance
of a feature depends on whether the VF or the MF is
considered. For the MF, feature selection has shown
syn and pos to be the most relevant features. They
alone bring the performance in the MF up to 75%. In
contrast, these two features explain only 56% of the

325



cases in the VF. This implies that the order in the MF
mainly depends on grammatical features, while for
the VF all features are important because removal of
any feature caused a loss in accuracy.

acc τ agr inv
TWO-STEP VF 68% - - -
TWO-STEP MF 80% 0.92 0.96 0.95

Table 4: Mean of the results for the VF and the MF

Another important finding is that there is no need
to overgenerate to find the right order. Insignificant
for clauses with two or three constituents, for clauses
with 10 constituents, the number of comparisons is
reduced drastically from 163,296,000 to 45.

According to the inv metric, our results are con-
siderably worse than those reported by Ringger et al.
(2004). As mentioned in Section 3, the fact that they
generate the order for every non-terminal node se-
riously inflates their numbers. Apart from that, they
do not report accuracy, and it is unknown, how many
sentences they actually reproduced correctly.

6.3 Error Analysis

To reveal the main error sources, we analyzed incor-
rect predictions concerning the VF and the MF, one
hundred for each. Most errors in the VF did not lead
to unacceptability or ungrammaticality. From lexi-
cal and semantic features, the classifier learned that
some expressions are often used in the beginning of
a sentence. These are temporal or locational PPs,
anaphoric adverbials, some connectives or phrases
starting with unlike X, together with X, as X, etc.
Such elements were placed in the VF instead of the
subject and caused an error although both variants
were equally acceptable. In other cases the classi-
fier could not find a better candidate but the subject
because it could not conclude from the provided fea-
tures that another constituent would nicely introduce
the sentence into the discourse. Mainly this con-
cerns recognizing information familiar to the reader
not by an already mentioned entity, but one which is
inferrable from what has been read.

In the MF, many orders had a PP transposed with
the direct object. In some cases the predicted order
seemed as good as the correct one. Often the algo-
rithm failed at identifying verb-specific preferences:

E.g., some verbs take PPs with the locational mean-
ing as an argument and normally have them right
next to them, whereas others do not. Another fre-
quent error was the wrong placement of superficially
identical constituents, e.g. two PPs of the same size.
To handle this error, the system needs more spe-
cific semantic information. Some errors were caused
by the parser, which created extra constituents (e.g.
false PP or adverb attachment) or confused the sub-
ject with the direct verb.

We retrained our system on a corpus of newspaper
articles (Telljohann et al., 2003, TüBa-D/Z) which is
manually annotated but encodes no semantic knowl-
edge. The results for the MF were the same as on the
data from Wikipedia. The results for the VF were
much worse (45%) because of the lack of semantic
information.

7 Conclusion

We presented a novel approach to ordering con-
stituents in German. The results indicate that a
linguistically-motivated two-step system, which first
selects a constituent for the initial position and then
orders the remaining ones, works significantly better
than approaches which do not make this separation.
Our results also confirm the hypothesis – which has
been attested in several corpus studies – that the or-
der in the MF is rather rigid and dependent on gram-
matical properties.

We have also demonstrated that there is no need
to overgenerate to find the best order. On a prac-
tical side, this finding reduces the amount of work
considerably. Theoretically, it lets us conclude that
the relatively fixed order in the MF depends on the
salience which can be predicted mainly from gram-
matical features. It is much harder to predict which
element should be placed in the VF. We suppose that
this difficulty comes from the double function of the
initial position which can either introduce the ad-
dressation topic, or be the scene- or frame-setting
position (Jacobs, 2001).
