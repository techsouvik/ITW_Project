Abstract

While the average performance of statisti-
cal parsers gradually improves, they still at-
tach to many sentences annotations of rather
low quality. The number of such sentences
grows when the training and test data are
taken from different domains, which is the
case for major web applications such as in-
formation retrieval and question answering.

In this paper we present a Sample Ensem-
ble Parse Assessment (SEPA) algorithm for
detecting parse quality. We use a function
of the agreement among several copies of
a parser, each of which trained on a differ-
ent sample from the training data, to assess
parse quality. We experimented with both
generative and reranking parsers (Collins,
Charniak and Johnson respectively). We
show superior results over several baselines,
both when the training and test data are from
the same domain and when they are from
different domains. For a test setting used by
previous work, we show an error reduction
of 31% as opposed to their 20%.

1 Introduction

Many algorithms for major NLP applications such
as information extraction (IE) and question answer-
ing (QA) utilize the output of statistical parsers
(see (Yates et al., 2006)). While the average per-
formance of statistical parsers gradually improves,
the quality of many of the parses they produce is
too low for applications. When the training and test

data are taken from different domains (the parser
adaptation scenario) the ratio of such low quality
parses becomes even higher. Figure 1 demonstrates
these phenomena for two leading models, Collins
(1999) model 2, a generative model, and Charniak
and Johnson (2005), a reranking model. The parser
adaptation scenario is the rule rather than the excep-
tion for QA and IE systems, because these usually
operate over the highly variable Web, making it very
difficult to create a representative corpus for manual
annotation. Medium quality parses may seriously
harm the performance of such systems.

In this paper we address the problem of assess-
ing parse quality, using a Sample Ensemble Parse
Assessment (SEPA) algorithm. We use the level of
agreement among several copies of a parser, each of
which trained on a different sample from the training
data, to predict the quality of a parse. The algorithm
does not assume uniformity of training and test data,
and is thus suitable to web-based applications such
as QA and IE.

Generative statistical parsers compute a probabil-
ity p(a, s) for each sentence annotation, so the im-
mediate technique that comes to mind for assess-
ing parse quality is to simply use p(a, s). Another
seemingly trivial method is to assume that shorter
sentences would be parsed better than longer ones.
However, these techniques produce results that are
far from optimal. In Section 5 we show the superi-
ority of our method over these and other baselines.

Surprisingly, as far as we know there is only one
previous work explicitly addressing this problem
(Yates et al., 2006). Their WOODWARD algorithm
filters out high quality parses by performing seman-

tic analysis. The present paper provides a detailed
comparison between the two algorithms, showing
both that SEPA produces superior results and that
it operates under less restrictive conditions.

We experiment with both the generative parsing
model number 2 of Collins (1999) and the reranking
parser of Charniak and Johnson (2005), both when
the training and test data belong to the same domain
(the in-domain scenario) and in the parser adapta-
tion scenario. In all four cases, we show substantial
improvement over the baselines. The present paper
is the first to use a reranking parser and the first to
address the adaptation scenario for this problem.

Section 2 discusses relevant previous work, Sec-
tion 3 describes the SEPA algorithm, Sections 4 and
5 present the experimental setup and results, and
Section 6 discusses certain aspects of these results
and compares SEPA to WOODWARD.

2 Related Work

The only previous work we are aware of that explic-
itly addressed the problem of detecting high quality
parses in the output of statistical parsers is (Yates et
al., 2006). Based on the observation that incorrect
parses often result in implausible semantic interpre-
tations of sentences, they designed the WOODWARD
filtering system. It first maps the parse produced by
the parser to a logic-based representation (relational
conjunction (RC)) and then employs four methods
for semantically analyzing whether a conjunct in the
RC is likely to be reasonable. The filters use seman-

tic information obtained from the Web. Measuring
errors using filter f-score (see Section 3) and using
the Collins generative model, WOODWARD reduces
errors by 67% on a set of TREC questions and by
20% on a set of a 100 WSJ sentences. Section 5
provides a detailed comparison with our algorithm.

Reranking algorithms (Koo and Collins, 2005;
Charniak and Johnson, 2005) search the list of best
parses output by a generative parser to find a parse of
higher quality than the parse selected by the genera-
tive parser. Thus, these algorithms in effect assess
parse quality using syntactic and lexical features.
The SEPA algorithm does not use such features, and
is successful in detecting high quality parses even
when working on the output of a reranker. Rerank-
ing and SEPA are thus relatively independent.

Bagging (Breiman, 1996) uses an ensemble of in-
stances of a model, each trained on a sample of the
training data1. Bagging was suggested in order to
enhance classifiers; the classification outcome was
determined using a majority vote among the mod-
els. In NLP, bagging was used for active learning
for text classification (Argamon-Engelson and Da-
gan, 1999; McCallum and Nigam, 1998). Specif-
ically in parsing, (Henderson and Brill, 2000) ap-
plied a constituent level voting scheme to an en-
semble of bagged models to increase parser perfor-
mance, and (Becker and Osborne, 2005) suggested
an active learning technique in which the agreement
among an ensemble of bagged parsers is used to pre-
dict examples valuable for human annotation. They
reported experiments with small training sets only
(up to 5,000 sentences), and their agreement func-
tion is very different from ours. Both works experi-
mented with generative parsing models only.

Ngai and Yarowsky (2000) used an ensemble
based on bagging and partitioning for active learning
for base NP chunking. They select top items with-
out any graded assessment, and their f-complement
function, which slightly resembles our MF (see the
next section), is applied to the output of a classifier,
while our function is applied to structured output.

predictors in classifiers’ output to posterior proba-
bilities is given in (Caruana and Niculescu-Mizil,
2006). As far as we know, the application of a sam-
ple based parser ensemble for assessing parse qual-
ity is novel.

Many IE and QA systems rely on the output of
parsers (Kwok et al., 2001; Attardi et al., 2001;
Moldovan et al., 2003). The latter tries to address
incorrect parses using complex relaxation methods.
Knowing the quality of a parse could greatly im-
prove the performance of such systems.

3 The Sample Ensemble Parse Assessment
(SEPA) Algorithm

In this section we detail our parse assessment algo-
rithm. Its input consists of a parsing algorithm A, an
annotated training set TR, and an unannotated test
set TE. The output provides, for each test sentence,
the parse generated for it by A when trained on the
full training set, and a grade assessing the parse’s
quality, on a continuous scale between 0 to 100. Ap-
plications are then free to select a sentence subset
that suits their needs using our grades, e.g. by keep-
ing only high-quality parses, or by removing low-
quality parses and keeping the rest. The algorithm
has the following stages:

1. Choose N random samples of size S from the
training set TR. Each sample is selected with-
out replacement.

2. Train N copies of the parsing algorithm A,
each with one of the samples.

3. Parse the test set with each of the N models.

4. For each test sentence, compute the value of an
agreement function F between the models.

5. Sort the test set according to F ’s value.

The algorithm uses the level of agreement among
several copies of a parser, each trained on a different
sample from the training data, to predict the qual-
ity of a parse. The higher the agreement, the higher
the quality of the parse. Our approach assumes that
if the parameters of the model are well designed to
annotate a sentence with a high quality parse, then
it is likely that the model will output the same (or

a highly similar) parse even if the training data is
somewhat changed. In other words, we rely on the
stability of the parameters of statistical parsers. Al-
though this is not always the case, our results con-
firm that strong correlation between agreement and
parse quality does exist.

We explored several agreement functions. The
one that showed the best results is Mean F-score
(MF)2, defined as follows. Denote the models by
m1 . . .mN , and the parse provided by mi for sen-
tence s as mi(s). We randomly choose a model ml,
and compute

MF (s) =
1

N − 1

∑

i∈[1...N ],i6=l

fscore(mi, ml) (1)

We use two measures to evaluate the quality of
SEPA grades. Both measures are defined using a
threshold parameter T , addressing only sentences
whose SEPA grades are not smaller than T . We refer
to these sentences as T-sentences.

The first measure is the average f-score of the
parses of T-sentences. Note that we compute the
f-score of each of the selected sentences and then
average the results. This stands in contrast to the
way f-score is ordinarily calculated, by computing
the labeled precision and recall of the constituents
in the whole set and using these as the arguments of
the f-score equation. The ordinary f-score is com-
puted that way mostly in order to overcome the fact
that sentences differ in length. However, for appli-
cations such as IE and QA, which work at the single
sentence level and which might reach erroneous de-
cision due to an inaccurate parse, normalizing over
sentence lengths is less of a factor. For this reason,
in this paper we present detailed graphs for the aver-
age f-score. For completeness, Table 4 also provides
some of the results using the ordinary f-score.

The second measure is a generalization of the fil-
ter f-score measure suggested by Yates et al. (2006).
They define filter precision as the ratio of correctly
parsed sentences in the filtered set (the set the algo-
rithm choose) to total sentences in the filtered set and
filter recall as the ratio of correctly parsed sentences
in the filtered set to correctly parsed sentences in the

,

where P and R are the labeled precision and recall of the con-
stituents in the sentence relative to another parse.

whole set of sentences parsed by the parser (unfil-
tered set or test set). Correctly parsed sentences are
sentences whose parse got f-score of 100%.

Since requiring a 100% may be too restrictive, we
generalize this measure to filter f-score with param-
eter k. In our measure, the filter recall and precision
are calculated with regard to sentences that get an
f-score of k or more, rather than to correctly parsed
sentences. Filtered f-score is thus a special case of
our filtered f-score, with parameter 100.

We now discuss the effect of the number of mod-
els N and the sample size S. The discussion is based
on experiments (using development data, see Sec-
tion 4) in which all the parameters are fixed except
for the parameter in question, using our development
sections.

Regarding N (see Figure 2): As the number of
models increases, the number of T-sentences se-
lected by SEPA decreases and their quality im-
proves, in terms of both average f-score and filter
f-score (with k = 100). The fact that more mod-
els trained on different samples of the training data
agree on the syntactic annotation of a sentence im-
plies that this syntactic pattern is less sensitive to
perturbations in the training data. The number of
such sentences is small and it is likely the parser will
correctly annotate them. The smaller T-set size leads
to a decrease in filter recall, while the better quality
leads to an increase in filter precision. Since the in-
crease in filter precision is sharper than the decrease
in filter recall, filter f-score increases with the num-
ber of models N .

Regarding S3: As the sample size increases, the
number of T-sentences increases, and their qual-
ity degrades in terms of average f-score but im-
proves in terms of filter f-score (again, with param-
eter k = 100). The overlap among smaller sam-
ples is small and the data they supply is sparse. If
several models trained on such samples attach to a
sentence the same parse, this syntactic pattern must
be very prominent in the training data. The num-
ber of such sentences is small and it is likely that
the parser will correctly annotate them. Therefore
smaller sample size leads to smaller T-sets with high
average f-score. As the sample size increases, the T-
set becomes larger but the average f-score of a parse

Figure 2: The effect of the number of models N on
SEPA (Collins’ model). The scenario is in-domain,
sample size S = 33, 000 and T = 100. We see:
average f-score of T-sentences (left, solid curve and
left y-axis), filter f-score with k = 100 (left, dashed

decreases. The larger T-set size leads to increase in
filter recall, while the lower average quality leads
to decrease in filter precision. Since the increase in
filter recall is sharper than the decrease in filter pre-
cision, the result is that filter f-score increases with
the sample size S.

This discussion demonstrates the importance of
using both average f-score and filter f-score, since
the two measures reflect characteristics of the se-
lected sample that are not necessarily highly (or pos-
itively) correlated.

4 Experimental Setup

We performed experiments with two parsing mod-
els, the Collins (1999) generative model number
2 and the Charniak and Johnson (2005) reranking
model. For the first we used a reimplementation
(?). We performed experiments with each model
in two scenarios, in-domain and parser adaptation.
In both experiments the training data are sections
02-21 of the WSJ PennTreebank (about 40K sen-
tences). In the in-domain experiment the test data
is section 23 (2416 sentences) of WSJ and in the
parser adaptation scenario the test data is Brown test
section (2424 sentences). Development sections are
WSJ section 00 for the in-domain scenario (1981
sentences) and Brown development section for the
adaptation scenario (2424 sentences). Following

411



(Gildea, 2001), the Brown test and development sec-
tions consist of 10% of Brown sentences (the 9th and
10th of each 10 consecutive sentences in the devel-
opment and test sections respectively).

We performed experiments with many configu-
rations of the parameters N (number of models),
S (sample size) and F (agreement function). Due
to space limitations we describe only experiments
where the values of the parameters N, S and F are
fixed (F is MF , N and S are given in Section 5)
and the threshold parameter T is changed.

5 Results

We first explore the quality of the selected set in
terms of average f-score. In Section 3 we reported
that the quality of a selected T-set of parses increases
as the number of models N increases and sample
size S decreases. We therefore show the results for
relatively high N (20) and relatively low S (13,000,
which is about a third of the training set). Denote
the cardinality of the set selected by SEPA by n (it
is actually a function of T but we omit the T in order
to simplify notations).

We use several baseline models. The first, confi-
dence baseline (CB), contains the n sentences hav-
ing the highest parser assigned probability (when
trained on the whole training set). The second, min-
imum length (ML), contains the n shortest sentences
in the test set. Since many times it is easier to parse
short sentences, a trivial way to increase the aver-
age f-score measure of a set is simply to select short
sentences. The third, following (Yates et al., 2006),
is maximum recall (MR). MR simply predicts that all
test set sentences should be contained in the selected
T-set. The output set of this model gets filter recall of
1 for any k value, but its precision is lower. The MR
baseline is not relevant to the average f-score mea-
sure, because it selects all of the sentences in a set,
which leads to the same average as a random selec-
tion (see below). In order to minimize visual clutter,
for the filter f-score measure we use the maximum
recall (MR) baseline rather than the minimum length
(ML) baseline, since the former outperforms the lat-
ter. Thus, ML is only shown for the average f-score
measure. We have also experimented with a random
baseline model (containing n randomly selected test
sentences), whose results are the worst and which is

shown for reference.
Readers of this section may get confused between

the agreement threshold parameter T and the param-
eter k of the filter f-score measure. Please note: as to
T , SEPA sorts the test set by the values of the agree-
ment function. One can then select only sentences
whose agreement score is at least T . T ’s values are
on a continuous scale from 0 to 100. As to k, the fil-
ter f-score measure gives a grade. This grade com-
bines three values: (1) the number of sentences in
the set (selected by an algorithm) whose f-score rel-
ative to the gold standard parse is at least k, (2) the
size of the selected set, and (3) the total number of
sentences with such a parse in the whole test set. We
did not introduce separate notations for these values.

Figure 3 (top) shows average f-score results where
SEPA is applied to Collins’ generative model in the
in-domain (left) and adaptation (middle) scenarios.
SEPA outperforms the baselines for all values of the
agreement threshold parameter T . Furthermore, as
T increases, not only does the SEPA set quality in-
crease, but the quality differences between this set
and the baseline sets increases as well. The graphs
on the right show the number of sentences in the sets
selected by SEPA for each T value. As expected,
this number decreases as T increases.

Figure 3 (bottom) shows the same pattern of re-
sults for the Charniak reranking parser in the in-
domain (left) and adaptation (middle) scenarios. We
see that the effects of the reranker and SEPA are rel-
atively independent. Even after some of the errors of
the generative model were corrected by the reranker
by selecting parses of higher quality among the 50-
best, SEPA can detect parses of high quality from
the set of parsed sentences.

To explore the quality of the selected set in terms
of filter f-score, we recall that the quality of a se-
lected set of parses increases as both the number of
models N and the sample size S increase, and with
T . Therefore, for k = 85 . . . 100 we show the value
of filter f-score with parameter k when the parame-
ters configuration is a relatively high N (20), rela-
tively high S (33,000, which are about 80% of the
training set), and the highest T (100).

Figure 4 (top) shows filter f-score results for
Collins’ generative model in the in-domain (left)
and adaptation (middle) scenarios. As these graphs
show, SEPA outperforms CB and random for all val-

412



ues of the filter f-score parameter k, and outper-
forms the MR baseline where the value of k is 95 or
more. Although for small k values MR gets a higher
f-score than SEPA, the filter precision of SEPA is
much higher (right, shown for adaptation. The in-
domain pattern is similar and not shown). This stems
from the definition of the MR baseline, which sim-
ply predicts any sentence to be in the selected set.
Furthermore, since the selected set is meant to be
the input for systems that require high quality parses,
what matters most is that SEPA outperforms the MR
baseline at the high k ranges.

Figure 4 (bottom) shows the same pattern of re-
sults for the Charniak reranking parser in the in-
domain (left) and adaptation (middle) scenarios. As
for the average f-score measure, it demonstrates that
the effects of the reranker and SEPA algorithm are
relatively independent.

Tables 1 and 2 show the error reduction achieved
by SEPA for the filter f-score measure with param-
eters k = 95, 97, 100 (Table 1) and for the aver-
age f-score measure with several SEPA agreement
threshold (T ) values (Table 2) . The error reductions
achieved by SEPA for both measures are substantial.

Table 3 compares SEPA and WOODWARD on the
exact same test set used by (Yates et al., 2006)
(taken from WSJ sec 23). SEPA achieves error re-
duction of 31% over the MR baseline on this set,
compared to only 20% achieved by WOODWARD.
Not shown in the table, in terms of ordinary f-score
WOODWARD achieves error reduction of 37% while
SEPA achieves 43%. These numbers were the only
ones reported in (Yates et al., 2006).

For completeness of reference, Table 4 shows the
superiority of SEPA over CB in terms of the usual f-
score measure used by the parsing community (num-
bers are counted for constituents first). Results for
other baselines are even more impressive. The con-
figuration is similar to that of Figure 3.

6 Discussion

In this paper we introduced SEPA, a novel algorithm
for assessing parse quality in the output of a statis-
tical parser. SEPA is the first algorithm shown to
be successful when a reranking parser is considered,
even though such models use a reranker to detect
and fix some of the errors made by the base gener-

Figure 3: Agreement threshold T vs. average f-score (left and middle) and number of sentences in the se-
lected set (right), for SEPA with Collins’ generative model (top) and the Charniak reranking model (bottom).
SEPA parameters are S = 13, 000, N = 20. In both rows, SEPA results for the in-domain (left) and adap-
tation (middle) scenarios are compared to the confidence (CB) and minimum length (ML) baselines. The
graphs on the right show the number of sentences in the selected set for both scenarios.

Figure 4: Parameter k vs. filter f-score (left and middle) and filter precision (right) with that parameter, for
SEPA with Collins’ generative model (top) and the Charniak reranking model (bottom). SEPA parameters
are S = 33, 000, N = 20, T = 100. In both rows, results for the in-domain (left) and adaptation (middle)
scenarios. In two leftmost graphs, the performance of the algorithm is compared to the confidence baseline
(CB) and maximum recall (MR). The graphs on the right compare the filter precision of SEPA with that of
the MR and CB baselines.

the parsing model. In the Web environment this is
the common situation.

The WSJ and Brown experiments performed with
SEPA are much broader than those performed with
WOODWARD, considering all sentences of WSJ sec
23 and Brown test section rather than a subset
of carefully selected sentences from WSJ sec 23.
However, we did not perform a TREC experiment,
as (Yates et al., 2006) did. Our WSJ and Brown
results outperformed several baselines. Moreover,
WSJ (or Brown) sentences that contain conjunctions
were avoided in the experiments of (Yates et al.,
2006). We have verified that our algorithm shows
substantial error reduction over the baselines for this
type of sentences (in the ranges 13 − 46% for the
filter f-score with k = 100, and 30 − 60% for the
average f-score).

As Table 3 shows, on a WSJ sec 23 test set similar
to that used by (Yates et al., 2006), SEPA achieves
31% error reduction compared to 20% of WOOD-
WARD.

WOODWARD works under several assumptions.
Specifically, it requires a corpus whose content over-
laps at least in part with the content of the parsed
sentences. This corpus is used to extract semanti-
cally related statistics for its filters. Furthermore, the
filters of this algorithm (except of the QA filter) are
focused on verb and preposition relations. Thus, it
is more natural for it to deal with mistakes contained
in such relations. This is reflected in the WSJ based
test set on which it is tested. SEPA does not make
any of these assumptions. It does not use any exter-
nal information source and is shown to select high
quality parses from diverse sets.

N = 20, S = 13, 000, T = 100.

For future work, integrating SEPA into the rerank-
ing process seems a promising direction for enhanc-
ing overall parser performance.
