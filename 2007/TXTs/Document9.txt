Abstract

Human categorization is neither a binary nor
a context-free process. Rather, some con-
cepts are better examples of a category than
others, while the criteria for category mem-
bership may be satisfied to different degrees
by different concepts in different contexts.
In light of these empirical facts, WordNet’s
static category structure appears both exces-
sively rigid and unduly fragile for process-
ing real texts. In this paper we describe a
syntagmatic, corpus-based approach to re-
defining WordNet’s categories in a func-
tional, gradable and context-sensitive fash-
ion. We describe how the diagnostic prop-
erties for these definitions are automati-
cally acquired from the web, and how the
increased flexibility in categorization that
arises from these redefinitions offers a ro-
bust account of metaphor comprehension
in the mold of Glucksberg’s (2001) the-
ory of category-inclusion. Furthermore, we
demonstrate how this competence with figu-
rative categorization can effectively be gov-
erned by automatically-generated ontologi-
cal constraints, also acquired from the web.

1 Introduction

Linguistic variation across contexts is often symp-
tomatic of ontological differences between contexts.
These observable variations can serve as valuable
clues not just to the specific senses of words in con-
text (e.g., see Pustejovsky, Hanks and Rumshisky,

2004) but to the underlying ontological structure it-
self (see Cimiano, Hotho and Staab, 2005). The
most revealing variations are syntagmatic in nature,
which is to say, they look beyond individual word
forms to larger patterns of contiguous usage (Hanks,
2004). In most contexts, the similarity between
chocolate, say, and a narcotic like heroin will mea-
gerly reflect the simple ontological fact that both are
kinds of substances; certainly, taxonomic measures
of similarity as discussed in Budanitsky and Hirst
(2006) will capture little more than this common-
ality. However, in a context in which the addictive
properties of chocolate are very salient (e.g., an on-
line dieting forum), chocolate is more likely to be
categorized as a drug and thus be considered more
similar to heroin. Look, for instance, at the simi-
lar ways in which these words can be used: one can
be ”chocolate-crazed” or ”chocolate-addicted” and
suffer ”chocolate-induced” symptoms (e.g., each of
these uses can be found in the pages of Wikipedia).
In a context that gives rise to these expressions, it is
unsurprising that chocolate should appear altogether
more similar to a harmful narcotic.

In this paper we computationally model this idea
that language use reflects category structure. As
noted by De Leenheer and de Moor (2005), ontolo-
gies are lexical representations of concepts, so we
can expect the effects of context on language use
to closely reflect the effects of context on ontolog-
ical structure. An understanding of the linguistic ef-
fects of context, as expressed through syntagmatic
patterns of word usage, should lead therefore to the
design of more flexible lexical ontologies that natu-
rally adapt to their contexts of use. WordNet (Fell-

57



baum, 1998) is just one such lexical ontology that
can benefit greatly from the added flexibility that
context-sensitivity can bring. Though comprehen-
sive in scale and widely used, WordNet suffers from
an obvious structural rigidity in which concepts are
either entirely within a category or entirely outside
a category: no gradation of category membership
is allowed, and no contextual factors are brought to
bear on criteria for membership. Thus, a gun is al-
ways a weapon in WordNet while an axe is never so,
despite the uses (sporting or murderous) to which
each can be put.

In section two we describe a computational
framework for giving WordNet senses a functional,
context-sensitive form. These functional forms si-
multaneously represent i) an intensional definition
for each word sense; ii) a structured query capable
of retrieving instances of the corresponding category
from a context-specific corpus; and iii) a member-
ship function that assigns gradated scores to these
instances based on available syntagmatic evidence.
In section three we describe how the knowledge re-
quired to automate this functional re-definition is ac-
quired from the web and linked to WordNet. In sec-
tion four we describe how these re-definitions can
produce a robust model of metaphor, before we eval-
uate the descriptive sufficiency of this approach in
section five, comparing it to the knowledge already
available within WordNet. We conclude with some
final remarks in section six.

2 Functional Context-Sensitive Categories

We take a wholly textual view of context and as-
sume that a given context can be implicitly charac-
terized by a representative text corpus. This corpus
can be as large as a text archive or an encyclopedia
(e.g., the complete text of Wikipedia), or as small
as a single document, a sentence or even a single
noun-phrase. For instance, the micro-context ”alco-
holic apple-juice” is enough to implicate the cate-
gory Liquor, rather than Juice, as a semantic head,
while ”lovable snake” can be enough of a context to
locally categorize Snake as a kind of Pet. There is a
range of syntagmatic patterns that one can exploit to
glean category insights from a text. For instance, the
”X kills” pattern is enough to categorize X as a kind
of Killer, ”hunts X” is enough to categorize X as

a kind of Prey, while ”X-covered”, ”X-dipped” and
”X-frosted” all indicate that X is a kind of Covering.
Likewise, ”army of X” suggests that a context views
X as a kind of Soldier, while ”barrage of X” suggests
that X should be seen as a kind of Projectile.

We operationalize the collocation-type of adjec-
tive and noun via the function (attr ADJ NOUN),
which returns a number in the range 0...1; this
represents the extent to which ADJ is used to
modify NOUN in the context-defining corpus.
Dice’s coefficient (e.g., see Cimiano et al., 2005) is
used to implement this measure. A context-sensitive
category membership function can be defined, as in
that for Fundamentalist in Figure 1:

(define Fundamentalist.0 (arg0)
(* (max

(%isa arg0 Person.0)
(%isa arg0 Group.0))

(min
(max

(attr political arg0)
(attr religious arg0))

(max
(attr extreme arg0)
(attr violent arg0)
(attr radical arg0)))))

Figure 1. A functional re-definition of the cat-
egory Fundamentalist.

The function of Figure 1 takes, as a single ar-
gument arg0, a putative member of the category
Fundamentalist.0 (note how the sense tag, 0, is
used to identify a specific WordNet sense of ”fun-
damentalist”), and returns a membership score in
the range 0...1 for this term. This score reflects the
syntagmatic evidence for considering arg0 to be
political or religious, as well as extreme or violent
or radical. The function (%isa arg0 CAT) returns a
value of 1.0 if some sense of arg0 is a descendent
of CAT (here Person.0 or Group.0), otherwise 0.
This safeguards ontological coherence and ensures
that only kinds of people or groups can ever be
considered as fundamentalists.

The example of Figure 1 is hand-crafted, but a
functional form can be assigned automatically to
many of the synsets in WordNet by heuristic means.

58



For instance, those of Figure 2 are automatically
derived from WordNet’s morpho-semantic links:

(define Fraternity.0 (arg0)
(* (%sim arg0 Fraternity.0)

(max
(attr fraternal arg0)
(attr brotherly arg0))))

(define Orgasm.0 (arg0)
(* (%sim arg0 Orgasm.0)

(max
(attr climactic arg0)
(attr orgasmic arg0))))

Figure 2. Exploiting the WordNet links be-
tween nouns and their adjectival forms.

The function (%sim arg0 CAT) reflects the
perceived similarity between the putative member
arg0 and a synset CAT in WordNet, using one of
the standard formulations described in Budanitsky
and Hirst (2006). Thus, any kind of group (e.g., a
glee club, a Masonic lodge, or a barbershop quartet)
described in a text as ”fraternal” or ”brotherly”
(both occupy the same WordNet synset) can be
considered a Fraternity to the corresponding degree,
tempered by its a priori similarity to a Fraternity;
likewise, any climactic event can be categorized as
an Orgasm to a more or less degree.

Alternately, the function of Figure 3 is automat-
ically obtained for the lexical concept Espresso by
shallow parsing its WordNet gloss: ”strong black
coffee brewed by forcing steam under pressure
through powdered coffee beans”.

(define Espresso.0 (arg0)
(* (%sim arg0 Espresso.0)

(min
(attr strong arg0)
(attr black arg0))))

Figure 3. A functional re-definition of the cat-
egory Espresso based on its WordNet gloss.

It follows that any substance (e.g., oil or tea)
described locally as ”black” and ”strong” with a

non-zero taxonomic similarity to coffee can be
considered a kind of Espresso.

Combining the contents of WordNet 1.6 and
WordNet 2.1, 27,732 different glosses (shared by
51,035 unique word senses) can be shallow parsed to
yield a definition of the kind shown in Figure 3. Of
these, 4525 glosses yield two or more properties that
can be given functional form via attr. However, one
can question whether these features are sufficient,
and more importantly, whether they are truly diag-
nostic of the categories they are used to define. In
the next section we consider another source of diag-
nostic properties, explicit similes on the web, before,
in section 5, comparing the quality of these proper-
ties to those available from WordNet.

3 Diagnostic Properties on the Web

We employ the Google search engine as a retrieval
mechanism for acquiring the diagnostic properties
of categories from the web, since the Google API
and its support for the wildcard term * allows this
process to be fully automated. The guiding intu-
ition here is that looking for explicit similes of the
form ”X is as P as Y” is the surest way of finding
the most salient properties of a term Y; with other
syntagmatic patterns, such as adjective:noun collo-
cations, one cannot be sure that the adjective is cen-
tral to the noun.

Since we expect that explicit similes will tend to
exploit properties that occupy an exemplary point on
a scale, we first extract a list of antonymous adjec-
tives, such as ”hot” or ”cold”, from WordNet. For
every adjective ADJ on this list, we send the query
”as ADJ as *” to Google and scan the first 200 snip-
pets returned to extract different noun values for the
wildcard *. From each set of snippets we can also
ascertain the relative frequencies of different noun
values for ADJ. The complete set of nouns extracted
in this way is then used to drive a second phase of
the search, in which the query template ”as * as a
NOUN” is used to acquire similes that may have
lain beyond the 200-snippet horizon of the original
search, or that may hinge on adjectives not included
on the original list. Together, both phases collect
a wide-ranging series of core samples (of 200 hits
each) from across the web, yielding a set of 74,704
simile instances (of 42,618 unique types) relating

59



3769 different adjectives to 9286 different nouns

3.1 Property Filtering

Unfortunately, many of these similes are not suffi-
ciently well-formed to identify salient properties. In
many cases, the noun value forms part of a larger
noun phrase: it may be the modifier of a compound
noun (as in ”bread lover”), or the head of complex
noun phrase (such as ”gang of thieves” or ”wound
that refuses to heal”). In the former case, the com-
pound is used if it corresponds to a compound term
in WordNet and thus constitutes a single lexical unit;
if not, or if the latter case, the simile is rejected.
Other similes are simply too contextual or under-
specified to function well in a null context, so if one
must read the original document to make sense of
the simile, it is rejected. More surprisingly, per-
haps, a substantial number of the retrieved simi-
les are ironic, in which the literal meaning of the
simile is contrary to the meaning dictated by com-
mon sense. For instance, ”as hairy as a bowling
ball” (found once) is an ironic way of saying ”as
hairless as a bowling ball” (also found just once).
Many ironies can only be recognized using world
knowledge, such as ”as sober as a Kennedy” and ”as
tanned as an Irishman”.

Given the creativity involved in these construc-
tions, one cannot imagine a reliable automatic fil-
ter to safely identify bona-fide similes. For this
reason, the filtering task is performed by a human
judge, who annotated 30,991 of these simile in-
stances (for 12,259 unique adjective/noun pairings)
as non-ironic and meaningful in a null context; these
similes relate a set of 2635 adjectives to a set of
4061 different nouns. In addition, the judge also
annotated 4685 simile instances (of 2798 types) as
ironic; these similes relate a set of 936 adjectives
to a set of 1417 nouns. Perhaps surprisingly, ironic
pairings account for over 13% of all annotated sim-
ile instances and over 20% of all annotated types.

3.2 Linking to WordNet Senses

To create functional WordNet definitions from these
adjective:noun pairings, we first need to identify the
WordNet sense of each noun. For instance, ”as stiff
as a zombie” might refer either to a re-animated
corpse or to an alcoholic cocktail (both are senses
of ”zombie” in WordNet, and drinks can be ”stiff”

too). Disambiguation is trivial for nouns with just
a single sense in WordNet. For nouns with two or
more fine-grained senses that are all taxonomically
close, such as ”gladiator” (two senses: a boxer and a
combatant), we consider each sense to be a suitable
target. In some cases, the WordNet gloss for as par-
ticular sense will literally mention the adjective of
the simile, and so this sense is chosen. In all other
cases, we employ a strategy of mutual disambigua-
tion to relate the noun vehicle in each simile to a spe-
cific sense in WordNet. Two similes ”as A as N1”
and ”as A as N2” are mutually disambiguating if N1
and N2 are synonyms in WordNet, or if some sense
of N1 is a hypernym or hyponym of some sense of
N2 in WordNet. For instance, the adjective ”scary”
is used to describe both the noun ”rattler” and the
noun ”rattlesnake” in bona-fide (non-ironic) similes;
since these nouns share a sense, we can assume that
the intended sense of ”rattler” is that of a danger-
ous snake rather than a child’s toy. Similarly, the
adjective ”brittle” is used to describe both saltines
and crackers, suggesting that it is the bread sense of
”cracker” rather than the hacker, firework or hillbilly
senses (all in WordNet) that is intended.

These heuristics allow us to automatically disam-
biguate 10,378 bona-fide simile types (85%), yield-
ing a mapping of 2124 adjectives to 3778 different
WordNet senses. Likewise, 77% (or 2164) of the
simile types annotated as ironic are disambiguated
automatically. A remarkable stability is observed in
the alignment of noun vehicles to WordNet senses:
100% of the ironic vehicles always denote the same
sense, no matter the adjective involved, while 96%
of bona-fide vehicles always denote the same sense.
This stability suggests two conclusions: the dis-
ambiguation process is consistent and accurate; but
more intriguingly, only one coarse-grained sense of
any word is likely to be sufficiently exemplary of
some property to be useful in a simile.

4 From Similes to Category Functions

As noted in section 3, the filtered web data yields
12,259 bona-fide similes describing 4061 target
nouns in terms of 2635 different adjectival prop-
erties. Word-sense disambiguation allows 3778
synsets in WordNet to be given a functional re-
definition in terms of 2124 diagnostic properties, as

60



in the definition of Gladiator in Figure 4:

(define Gladiator.0 (arg0)
(* (%isa arg0 Person.0)

(* (%sim arg0 Gladiator.0)
(combine

(attr strong arg0)
(attr violent arg0)
(attr manly arg0)))))

Figure 4. A web-based definition of Gladiator.

Since we cannot ascertain from the web data
which properties are necessary and which are
collectively sufficient, we use the function combine
to aggregate the available evidence. This function
implements a naı̈ve probabilistic or, in which each
piece of syntagmatic evidence is naively assumed to
be independent, as follows:

(combine e0 e1) = e0 + e1(1 − e0)
(combine e0 e1 ...en) = (combine e0 (combine e1 ...en))

Thus, any combatant or competitor (such as a
sportsman) that is described as strong, violent or
manly in a corpus can be categorized as a Gladiator
in that context; the more properties that hold, and
the greater the degree to which they hold, the greater
the membership score that is assigned.

The source of the hard taxonomic constraint
(%isa arg0 Person.0) is explained in the next sec-
tion. For now, note how the use of %sim in the
functions of Figures 2, 3 and 4 means that these
membership functions readily admit both literal and
metaphoric members. Since the line between lit-
eral and metaphoric uses of a category is often im-
possible to draw, the best one can do is to accept
metaphor as a gradable phenomenon (see Hanks,
2006). The incorporation of taxonomic similarity
via %sim ensures that literal members will tend to
receive higher membership scores, and that the most
tenuous metaphors will receive the lowest member-
ship scores (close to 0.0).

4.1 Constrained Category Inclusion

Simile and metaphor involve quite different con-
ceptual mechanisms. For instance, anything that
is particularly strong or black might meaningfully

be called ”as black as espresso” or ”as strong
as espresso”, yet few such things can meaning-
fully be called just ”espresso”. While simile is a
mechanism for highlighting inter-concept similarity,
metaphor is at heart a mechanism of category inclu-
sion (see Glucksberg, 2001). As the espresso exam-
ple demonstrates, category inclusion is more than a
matter of shared properties: humans have strong in-
tuitions about the structure of categories and the ex-
tent to which they can be stretched to include new
members. So while it is sensible to apply the cat-
egory Espresso to other substances, preferably liq-
uids, it seems nonsensical to apply the category to
animals, artifacts, places and so on.

Much as the salient properties of categories can
be acquired form the web (see section 3), so too
can the intuitions governing inclusion amongst cat-
egories. For instance, an attested web-usage of the
phrase ”Espresso-like CAT” tells us that sub-types
of CAT are allowable targets of categorization by the
category Espresso. Thus, since the query ”espresso-
like substance” returns 3 hits via Google, types of
substance (oil, etc.) can be described as Espresso if
they are contextually strong and black. In contrast,
the query ”espresso-like person” returns 0 hits, so
no instance of person can be described as Espresso,
no matter how black or how strong. While this is
clearly a heuristic approach to a complex cognitive
problem, it does allow us to tap into the tacit knowl-
edge that humans employ in categorization. More
generally, a concept X can be included in a category
C if X exhibits salient properties of C and, for some
hypernym H of X in WordNet, we can find an at-
tested use of ”C-like H” on the web.

If we can pre-fetch all possible ”C-like H”
from the web, this will allow comprehension to
proceed without having to resort to web analysis
in mid-categorization. While there are too many
possible values of H to make full pre-fetching a
practical reality, we can generalize the problem
somewhat, by selecting a range of values for H
from the middle-layer of WordNet, such as Person,
Substance, Animal, Tool, Plant, Structure, Event,
Vehicle, Idea and Place, and by pre-fetching the
query ”C-like H” for all 4061 nouns collected in
section 3, combined with this limited set of H
values. For every noun in our database then, we pre-
compile a vector of possible category inclusions.

61



For instance, ”lattice” yields the following vector:

{structure(1620), substance(8), container(1),
vehicle(1)}

where numbers in parentheses indicate the web-
frequency of the corresponding ”Lattice-like H”
query. Thus, the category Lattice can be used to
describe (and metaphorically include) other kinds
of structure (like crystals), types of substance (e.g.,
crystalline substances), containers (like honey-
combs) and even vehicles (e.g., those with many
compartments). Likewise, the noun ”snake” yields
the following vector of possibilities:

{structure(125), animal(122), person(56), ve-
hicle(17), tool(9)}

(note, the frequency for ”person” includes the
frequency for ”man” and ”woman”). The category
Snake can also be used to describe and include
structures (like tunnels), other animals (like eels),
people (e.g., the dishonest variety), vehicles (e.g.,
articulated trucks, trains) and tools (e.g., hoses). The
noun ”gladiator” yields a vector of just one element,
{person(1)}, from which the simple constraint
(%isa arg0 Person.0) in Figure 4 is derived. In con-
trast, ”snake” is now given the definition of Figure 5:

(define Snake.0 (arg0)
(* (max

(%isa arg0 Structure.0)
(%isa arg0 Animal.0)
(%isa arg0 Person.0)
(%isa arg0 Vehicle.0))

(* (%sim arg0 Snake.0)
(combine

(attr cunning arg0)
(attr slippery arg0)
(attr flexible arg0)
(attr slim arg0)
(attr sinuous arg0)
(attr crooked arg0)
(attr deadly arg0)
(attr poised arg0)))))

Figure 5. A membership function for Snake
using web-derived category-inclusion constraints.

Glucksberg (2001) notes that the same category,
used figuratively, can exhibit different qualities in
different metaphors. For instance, Snake might
describe a kind of crooked person in one metaphor,
a poised killer in another metaphor, and a kind of
flexible tool in yet another. The use of combine
in Figure 5 means that a single category definition
can give rise to each of these perspectives in the
appropriate contexts. We therefore do not need a
different category definition for each metaphoric
use of Snake.

To illustrate the high-level workings of category-
inclusion, Table 1 generalizes over the set of 3778
disambiguated nouns from section 3 to estimate the
propensity for one semantic category, like Person, to
include members of another category, like Animal,
in X-like Y constructs.

X-like Y P A Sub T Str
(P)erson .66 .05 .03 .04 .09
(A)nimal .36 .27 .04 .05 .15

(Sub)stance .14 .03 .37 .05 .32
(T)ool .08 .03 .07 .22 .34

(Str)ucture .04 .03 .03 .03 .43

Table 1. The Likelihood of a category X accommo-
dating a category Y.

Table 1 reveals that 36% of ”ANIMAL-like”
patterns on the web describe a kind of Person,
while only 5% of ”PERSON-like” patterns on the
web describe a kind of Animal. Category inclusion
appears here to be a conservative mechanism, with
like describing like in most cases; thus, types of
Person are most often used to describe other kinds
of Person (comprising 66% of ”PERSON-like”
patterns), types of substance to describe other sub-
stances, and so on. The clear exception is Animal,
with ”ANIMAL-like” phrases more often used to
describe people (36%) than other kinds of animal
(27%). The anthropomorphic uses of this category
demonstrate the importance of folk-knowledge in
figurative categorization, of the kind one is more
likely to find in real text, and on the web (as in
section 3), rather than in resources like WordNet.

5 Empirical Evaluation

The simile gathering process of section 3, abetted
by Google’s practice of ranking pages according to
popularity, should reveal the most frequently-used
comparative nouns, and thus, the most useful cat-
egories to capture in a general-purpose ontology
like WordNet. But the descriptive sufficiency of
these categories is not guaranteed unless the defin-
ing properties ascribed to each can be shown to
be collectively rich enough, and individually salient
enough, to predict how each category is perceived
and applied by a language user.

If similes are indeed a good basis for mining
the most salient and diagnostic properties of cate-
gories, we should expect the set of properties for
each category to accurately predict how the cate-
gory is perceived as a whole. For instance, humans
– unlike computers – do not generally adopt a dis-
passionate view of ideas, but rather tend to asso-
ciate certain positive or negative feelings, or affec-
tive values, with particular ideas. Unsavoury activi-
ties, people and substances generally possess a nega-
tive affect, while pleasant activities and people pos-
sess a positive affect. Whissell (1989) reduces the
notion of affect to a single numeric dimension, to
produce a dictionary of affect that associates a nu-
meric value in the range 1.0 (most unpleasant) to 3.0
(most pleasant) with over 8000 words in a range of
syntactic categories (including adjectives, verbs and
nouns). So to the extent that the adjectival proper-
ties yielded by processing similes paint an accurate
picture of each category / noun-sense, we should be
able to predict the affective rating of each vehicle
via a weighted average of the affective ratings of
the adjectival properties ascribed to these nouns (i.e.,
where the affect rating of each adjective contributes
to the estimated rating of a noun in proportion to
its frequency of co-occurrence with that noun in our
simile data). More specifically, we should expect
that ratings estimated via these simile-derived prop-
erties should correlate well with the independent rat-
ings contained in Whissell’s dictionary.

To determine whether similes do offer the clearest
perspective on a category’s most salient properties,
we calculate and compare this correlation using the
following data sets:

A. Adjectives derived from annotated bona-fide
(non-ironic) similes only.

B. Adjectives derived from all annotated similes
(both ironic and non-ironic).

C. Adjectives derived from ironic similes only.

D. All adjectives used to modify a given noun in
a large corpus. We use over 2-gigabytes of
text from the online encyclopaedia Wikipedia
as our corpus.

E. The set of 63,935 unique property-of-noun
pairings extracted via shallow-parsing from
WordNet glosses in section 2, e.g., strong and
black for Espresso.

Predictions of affective rating were made from each
of these data sources and then correlated with the
ratings reported in Whissell’s dictionary of affect
using a two-tailed Pearson test (p < 0.01). As ex-
pected, property sets derived from bona-fide simi-
les only (A) yielded the best correlation (+0.514)
while properties derived from ironic similes only
(C) yielded the worst (-0.243); a middling corre-
lation coefficient of 0.347 was found for all simi-
les together, demonstrating the fact that bona-fide
similes outnumber ironic similes by a ratio of 4
to 1. A weaker correlation of 0.15 was found us-
ing the corpus-derived adjectival modifiers for each
noun (D); while this data provides quite large prop-
erty sets for each noun, these properties merely re-
flect potential rather than intrinsic properties of each
noun and so do not reveal what is most diagnostic
about a category. More surprisingly, property sets
derived from WordNet glosses (E) are also poorly
predictive, yielding a correlation with Whissell’s af-
fect ratings of just 0.278. This suggests that the
properties used to define categories in hand-crafted
resources like WordNet are not always those that ac-
tually reflect how humans think of these categories.

6 Concluding Remarks

Much of what we understand about different cate-
gories is based on tacit and defeasible knowledge of
the outside world, knowledge that cannot easily be
shoe-horned into the rigid is-a structure of an on-
tology like WordNet. This already-complex picture

63



is complicated even further by the often metaphoric
relationship between words and the categories they
denote, and by the fact that the metaphor/literal dis-
tinction is not binary but gradable. Furthermore, the
gradability of category membership is clearly influ-
enced by context: in a corpus describing the exploits
of Vikings, an axe will most likely be seen as a kind
of weapon, but in a corpus dedicated to forestry, it
will likely describe a tool. A resource like WordNet,
in which is-a links are reserved for category relation-
ships that are always true, in any context, is going to
be inherently limited when dealing with real text.

We have described an approach that can be seen as
a functional equivalent to the CPA (Corpus Pattern
Analysis) approach of Pustejovsky et al. (2004), in
which our goal is not that of automated induction of
word senses in context (as it is in CPA) but the au-
tomated induction of flexible, context-sensitive cat-
egory structures. As such, our goal is primarily on-
tological rather than lexicographic, though both ap-
proaches are complementary since each views syn-
tagmatic evidence as the key to understanding the
use of lexical concepts in context. By defining cat-
egory membership in terms of syntagmatic expec-
tations, we establish a functional and gradable ba-
sis for determining whether one lexical concept (or
synset) in WordNet deserves to be seen as a de-
scendant of another in a particular corpus and con-
text. Augmented with ontological constraints de-
rived from the usage of ”X-like Y” patterns on the
web, we also show how these membership functions
can implement Glucksberg’s (2001) theory of cate-
gory inclusion.

We have focused on just one syntagmatic pattern
here – adjectival modification of nouns – but cate-
gorization can be inferred from a wide range of pro-
ductive patterns in text, particularly those concern-
ing verbs and their case-fillers. For instance, verb-
centred similes of the form ”to V+inf like a|an N”
and ”to be V+past like a|an N” reveal insights into
the diagnostic behaviour of entities (e.g., that preda-
tors hunt, that prey is hunted, that eagles soar and
bombs explode). Taken together, adjective-based
properties and verb-based behaviours can paint an
even more comprehensive picture of each lexical
concept, so that e.g., political agents that kill can
be categorized as assassins, loyal entities that fight
can be categorized as soldiers, and so on. An im-

portant next step, then, is to mine these behaviours
from the web and incorporate the corresponding
syntagmatic expectations into our category defini-
tions. The symbolic nature of the resulting defini-
tions means these can serve not just as mathematical
membership functions, but as ”active glosses”, capa-
ble of recruiting their own members in a particular
context while demonstrating a flexibility with cate-
gorization and a genuine competence with metaphor.
