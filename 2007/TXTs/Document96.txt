Abstract

Over the last fifty years, the “Big Five”
model of personality traits has become a
standard in psychology, and research has
systematically documented correlations be-
tween a wide range of linguistic variables
and the Big Five traits. A distinct line of
research has explored methods for automati-
cally generating language that varies along
personality dimensions. We present PER-
SONAGE (PERSONAlity GEnerator), the
first highly parametrizable language gener-
ator for extraversion, an important aspect
of personality. We evaluate two personal-
ity generation methods: (1) direct genera-
tion with particular parameter settings sug-
gested by the psychology literature; and (2)
overgeneration and selection using statistical
models trained from judge’s ratings. Results
show that both methods reliably generate ut-
terances that vary along the extraversion di-
mension, according to human judges.

1 Introduction

Over the last fifty years, the “Big Five” model of per-
sonality traits has become a standard in psychology
(extraversion, neuroticism, agreeableness, conscien-
tiousness, and openness to experience), and research
has systematically documented correlations between
a wide range of linguistic variables and the Big Five
traits (Mehl et al., 2006; Norman, 1963; Oberlan-
der and Gill, 2006; Pennebaker and King, 1999). A
distinct line of research has explored methods for
automatically generating language that varies along
personality dimensions, targeting applications such
as computer gaming and educational virtual worlds
(André et al., 2000; Isard et al., 2006; Loyall and
Bates, 1997; Piwek, 2003; Walker et al., 1997) inter

alia. Other work suggests a clear utility for gener-
ating language manifesting personality (Reeves and
Nass, 1996). However, to date, (1) research in gener-
ation has not systematically exploited the psycholin-
guistic findings; and (2) there has been little evalua-
tion showing that automatic generators can produce
language with recognizable personality variation.

Table 1: Recommendations along the extraver-
sion dimension, with the average extraversion rating
from human judges on a scale from 1 to 7. Alt-2 and
3 are from the extravert set, Alt-4 and 5 are from the
introvert set, and others were randomly generated.

Our aim is to produce a highly parameterizable
generator whose outputs vary along personality di-
mensions. We hypothesize that such language can

496



be generated by varying parameters suggested by
psycholinguistic research. So, we must first map
the psychological findings to parameters of a natural
language generator (NLG). However, this presents
several challenges: (1) The findings result from
studies of genres of language, such as stream-of-
consciousness essays (Pennebaker and King, 1999),
and informal conversations (Mehl et al., 2006), and
thus may not apply to fixed content domains used in
NLG; (2) Most findings are based on self-reports of
personality, but we want to affect observer’s percep-
tions; (3) The findings consist of weak but signifi-
cant correlations, so that individual parameters may
not have a strong enough effect to produce recog-
nizable variation within a single utterance; (4) There
are many possible mappings of the findings to gen-
eration parameters; and (5) It is unclear whether
only specific speech-act types manifest personality
or whether all utterances do.

Thus this paper makes several contributions.
First, Section 2 summarizes the linguistic reflexes of
extraversion, organized by the modules in a standard
NLG system, and propose a mapping from these
findings to NLG parameters. To our knowledge this
is the first attempt to put forward a systematic frame-
work for generating language manifesting personal-
ity. We start with the extraversion dimension be-
cause it is an important personality factor, with many
associated linguistic variables. We believe that our
framework will generalize to the other dimensions
in the Big Five model. Second, Sections 3 and 4
describe the PERSONAGE (PERSONAlity GEner-
ator) generator and its 29 parameters. Table 1 shows
examples generated by PERSONAGE for recom-
mendations in the restaurant domain, along with
human extraversion judgments. Third, Sections 5
and 6 describe experiments evaluating two genera-
tion methods. We first show that (1) the parame-
ters generate utterances that vary significantly on the
extraversion dimension, according to human judg-
ments; and (2) we can train a statistical model that
matches human performance in assigning extraver-
sion ratings to generation outputs produced with ran-
dom parameter settings. Section 7 sums up and dis-
cusses future work.

2 Psycholinguistic Findings and
PERSONAGE Parameters

We hypothesize that personality can be made man-
ifest in evaluative speech acts in any dialogue do-
main, i.e. utterances responding to requests to REC-
OMMEND or COMPARE domain entities, such as
restaurants or movies (Isard et al., 2006; Stent et al.,

2004). Thus, we start with the SPaRKy genera-
tor1, which produces evaluative recommendations
and comparisons in the restaurant domain, for a
database of restaurants in New York City. There
are eight attributes for each restaurant: the name and
address, scalar attributes for price, food quality, at-
mosphere, and service and categorical attributes for
neighborhood and type of cuisine. SPaRKy is based
on the standard NLG architecture (Reiter and Dale,
2000), and consists of the following modules:

1. Content Planning: refine communicative goals, select and
structure content;

2. Sentence planning; choose linguistic resources (lexicon,
syntax) to achieve goals;

3. Realization: use grammar (syntax, morphology) to gen-
erate surface utterances.

Given the NLG architecture, speech-act types,
and domain, the first step then is to summarise psy-
chological findings on extraversion and map them
to this architecture. The column NLG modules of
Table 2 gives the proposed mapping. The first row
specifies findings for the content planning module
and the other rows are aspects of sentence planning.
Realization is achieved with the RealPro surface re-
alizer (Lavoie and Rambow, 1997). An examina-
tion of the introvert and extravert findings in Table 2
highlights the challenges above, i.e. exploiting these
findings in a systematic way within a parameteriz-
able NLG system.

The column Parameter in Table 2 proposes pa-
rameters (explained in Sections 3 and 4) that are ma-
nipulated within each module to realize the findings
in the other columns. Each parameter varies con-
tinuously from 0 to 1, where end points are meant
to produce extreme but plausible output. Given the
challenges above, it is important to note that these
parameters represent hypotheses about how a find-
ing can be mapped into any NLG system. The Intro
and Extra columns at the right hand side of the Pa-
rameter column indicate a range of settings for this
parameter, suggested by the psychological findings,
to produce introverted vs. extraverted language.

SPaRKy produces content plans for restaurant
recommendations and comparisons that are modi-
fied by the parameters. The sample content plan
for a recommendation in Figure 1 corresponds to
the outputs in Table 1. While Table 1 shows that
PERSONAGE’s parameters have various pragmatic
effects, they preserve the meaning at the Gricean in-
tention level (dialogue goal). Each content plan con-
tains a claim (nucleus) about the overall quality of

the selected restaurant(s), supported by a set of satel-
lite content items describing their attributes. See Ta-
ble 1. Claims can be expressed in different ways,
such as RESTAURANT NAME is the best, while
the attribute satellites follow the pattern RESTAU-
RANT NAME has MODIFIER ATTRIBUTE NAME,
as in Le Marais has good food. Recommendations
are characterized by a JUSTIFY rhetorical relation
associating the claim with all other content items,
which are linked together through an INFER relation.
In comparisons, the attributes of multiple restaurants
are compared using a CONTRAST relation. An op-

tional claim about the quality of all restaurants can
also be expressed as the nucleus of an ELABORATE
relation, with the rest of the content plan tree as a
satellite.

3 Content Planning

Content planning selects and structures the content
to be communicated. Table 2 specifies 10 param-
eters hypothesized to affect this process which are
explained below.

Content size: Extraverts are more talkative than
introverts (Furnham, 1990; Pennebaker and King,
1999), although it is not clear whether they actu-
ally produce more content, or are just redundant and
wordy. Thus various parameters relate to the amount
and type of content produced. The VERBOSITY pa-
rameter controls the number of content items se-
lected from the content plan. For example, Alt-5 in
Table 1 is terse, while Alt-2 expresses all the items in
the content plan. The REPETITION parameter adds
an exact repetition: the content item is duplicated
and linked to the original content by a RESTATE

498



rhetorical relation. In a similar way, the RESTATE-
MENT parameter adds paraphrases of content items
to the plan, that are obtained from the initial hand-
crafted generation dictionary (see Section 4.1) and
by automatically substituting content words with the
most frequent WordNet synonym (see Section 4.4).
Alt-9 in Table 1 contains restatements for the food
quality and the atmosphere attributes.

Polarity: Extraverts tend to be more positive; in-
troverts are characterized as engaging in more ‘prob-
lem talk’ and expressions of dissatisfaction (Thorne,
1987). To control for polarity, content items are
defined as positive or negative based on the scalar
value of the corresponding attribute. The type of cui-
sine and neighborhood attributes have neutral polar-
ity. There are multiple parameters associated with
polarity. The CONTENT POLARITY parameter con-
trols whether the content is mostly negative (e.g.
X has mediocre food), neutral (e.g. X is a Thai
restaurant), or positive. From the filtered set of
content items, the POLARISATION parameter deter-
mines whether the final content includes items with
extreme scalar values (e.g. X has fantastic staff).

In addition, polarity can also be implied more sub-
tly through rhetorical structure. The CONCESSIONS
parameter controls how negative and positive infor-
mation is presented, i.e. whether two content items
with different polarity are presented objectively, or if
one is foregrounded and the other backgrounded. If
two opposed content items are selected for a con-
cession, a CONCESS rhetorical relation is inserted
between them. While the CONCESSIONS param-
eter captures the tendency to put information into
perspective, the CONCESSION POLARITY parameter
controls whether the positive or the negative content
is concessed, i.e. marked as the satellite of the CON-
CESS relation. The last sentence of Alt-3 in Table 1
illustrates a positive concession, in which the good
food quality is put before the high price.

Content ordering: Although extraverts use more
positive language (Pennebaker and King, 1999;
Thorne, 1987), it is unclear how they position the
positive content within their utterances. Addition-
ally, the position of the claim affects the persuasive-
ness of an argument (Carenini and Moore, 2000):
starting with the claim facilitates the hearer’s under-
standing, while finishing with the claim is more ef-
fective if the hearer disagrees. The POSITIVE CON-
TENT FIRST parameter therefore controls whether
positive content items – including the claim – appear
first or last, and the order in which the content items
are aggregated. However, some operations can still
impose a specific ordering (e.g. BECAUSE cue word

to realize the JUSTIFY relation, see Section 4.2).

4 Sentence Planning
Sentence planning chooses the linguistic resources
from the lexicon and the syntactic and discourse
structures to achieve the communicative goals spec-
ified in the input content plan. Table 2 specifies four
sets of findings and parameters for different aspects
of sentence planning discussed below.

4.1 Syntactic template selection

PERSONAGE’s input generation dictionary is made
of 27 Deep Syntactic Structures (DSyntS): 9 for
the recommendation claim, 12 for the comparison
claim, and one per attribute. Selecting a DSyntS re-
quires assigning it automatically to a point in a three
dimensional space described below. All parameter
values are normalized over all the DSyntS, so the
DSyntS closest to the target value can be computed.

Syntactic complexity: Furnham (1990) suggests
that introverts produce more complex constructions:
the CLAIM COMPLEXITY parameter controls the
depth of the syntactic structure chosen to represent
the claim, e.g. the claim X is the best is rated as less
complex than X is one of my favorite restaurants.

Self-references: Extraverts make more self-
references than introverts (Pennebaker and King,
1999). The SELF-REFERENCE parameter controls
whether the claim is made in the first person, based
on the speaker’s own experience, or whether the
claim is reported as objective or information ob-
tained elsewhere. The self-reference value is ob-
tained from the syntactic structure by counting the
number of first person pronouns. For example, the
claim of Alt-2 in Table 1, i.e. I am sure you would
like Le Marais, will be rated higher than Le Marais
isn’t as bad as the others in Alt-5.

Polarity: While polarity can be expressed by con-
tent selection and structure, it can also be directly
associated with the DSyntS. The CLAIM POLARITY
parameter determines the DSyntS selected to realize
the claim. DSyntS are manually annotated for po-
larity. For example, Alt-4’s claim in Table 1, i.e. Le
Marais is the only restaurant that is any good, has a
lower polarity than Alt-2.

4.2 Aggregation operations

SPaRKy aggregation operations are used (See Stent
et al. (2004)), with additional operations for conces-
sions and restatements. See Table 2. The probabil-
ity of the operations biases the production of com-
plex clauses, periods and formal cue words for in-
troverts, to express their preference for complex syn-

499



tactic constructions, long pauses and rich vocabulary
(Furnham, 1990). Thus, the introvert parameters fa-
vor operations such as RELATIVE CLAUSE for the
INFER relation, PERIOD HOWEVER CUE WORD for
CONTRAST, and ALTHOUGH ADVERBIAL CLAUSE
for CONCESS, that we hypothesize to result in more
formal language. Extravert aggregation produces
longer sentences with simpler constructions and in-
formal cue words. Thus extravert utterances tend to
use operations such as a CONJUNCTION to realize
the INFER and RESTATE relations, and the EVEN IF
ADVERBIAL CLAUSE for CONCESS relations.

4.3 Pragmatic transformations

This section describes the insertion of markers in the
DSyntS to produce various pragmatic effects.

Hedges: Hedges correlate with introversion (Pen-
nebaker and King, 1999) and affect politeness
(Brown and Levinson, 1987). Thus there are param-
eters for inserting a wide range of hedges, both af-
fective and epistemic, such as kind of, sort of, quite,
rather, somewhat, like, around, err, I think that, it
seems that, it seems to me that, and I mean. Alt-5 in
Table 1 shows hedges err and it seems to me that.

To model extraverts use of more social language,
agreement and backchannel behavior (Dewaele and
Furnham, 1999; Pennebaker and King, 1999), we
use informal acknowledgments such as yeah, right,
ok. Acknowledgments that may affect introversion
are I see, expressing self-reference and cognitive
load, and the well cue word implying reservation
from the speaker (see Alt-9).

To model social connection and emotion we
added mechanisms for inserting emphasizers such as
you know, basically, actually, just have, just is, and
exclamations. Alt-3 in Table 1 shows the insertion
of you know and actually.

Although similar hedges can be grouped together,
each hedge has a unique pragmatic effect. For ex-
ample, you know implies positive-face redressment,
while actually doesn’t. A parameter for each hedge
controls the likelihood of its selection.

To control the general level of hedging, a HEDGE
VARIATION parameter defines how many different
hedges are selected (maximum of 5), while the fre-
quency of an individual hedge is controlled by a
HEDGE REPETITION parameter, up to a maximum
of 2 identical hedges per utterance.

The syntactic structure of hedges are defined as
well as constraints on their insertion point in the ut-
terance’s syntactic structure. Each time a hedge is
selected, it is randomly inserted at one of the inser-
tion points respecting the constraints, until the spec-

ified frequency is reached. For example, a constraint
on the hedge kind of is that it modifies adjectives.

Tag questions: Tag questions are also polite-
ness markers (Brown and Levinson, 1987). They
redress the hearer’s positive face by claiming com-
mon ground. A TAG QUESTION INSERTION param-
eter leads to negating the auxiliary of the verb and
pronominalizing the subject, e.g. X has great food
results in the insertion of doesn’t it?, as in Alt-8.

Negations: Introverts use significantly more
negations (Pennebaker and King, 1999). Although
the content parameters select more negative polarity
content items for introvert utterances, we also ma-
nipulate negations, while keeping the content con-
stant, by converting adjectives to the negative of
their antonyms, e.g. the atmosphere is nice was
transformed to not nasty in Alt-9 in Table 1.

Subject implicitness: Heylighen and Dewaele
(2002) found that extraverts use more implicit lan-
guage than introverts. To control the level of implic-
itness, the SUBJECT IMPLICITNESS parameter deter-
mines whether predicates describing restaurant at-
tributes are expressed with the restaurant in the sub-
ject, or with the attribute itself (e.g., it has good food
vs. the food is tasty in Alt-9).

4.4 Lexical choice

Introverts use a richer vocabulary (Dewaele and
Furnham, 1999), so the LEXICON FREQUENCY pa-
rameter selects lexical items by their normalized fre-
quency in the British National Corpus. WordNet
synonyms are used to obtain a pool of synonyms, as
well as adjectives extracted from a corpus of restau-
rant reviews for all levels of polarity (e.g. the ad-
jective tasty in Alt-9 is a high polarity modifier of
the food attribute). Synonyms are manually checked
to make sure they are interchangeable. For example,
the content item expressed originally as it has decent
service is transformed to it features friendly service
in Alt-2, and to the servers are nice in Alt-3.

5 Experimental Method and Hypotheses
Our primary hypothesis is that language generated
by varying parameters suggested by psycholinguis-
tic research can be recognized as extravert or in-
trovert. To test this hypothesis, three expert judges
evaluated a set of generated utterances as if they had
been uttered by a friend responding in a dialogue to a
request to recommend restaurants. These utterances
had been generated to systematically manipulate ex-
traversion/introversion parameters.

The judges rated each utterance for perceived ex-
traversion, by answering the two questions measur-

500



ing that trait from the Ten-Item Personality Inven-
tory, as this instrument was shown to be psychome-
trically superior to a ‘single item per trait’ question-
naire (Gosling et al., 2003). The answers are aver-
aged to produce an extraversion rating ranging from
1 (highly introvert) to 7 (highly extravert). Because
it was unclear whether the generation parameters in
Table 2 would produce natural sounding utterances,
the judges also evaluated the naturalness of each ut-
terance on the same scale. The judges rated 240 ut-
terances, grouped into 20 sets of 12 utterances gen-
erated from the same content plan. They rated one
randomly ordered set at a time, but viewed all 12
utterances in that set before rating them. The ut-
terances were generated to meet two experimental
goals. First, to test the direct control of the per-
ception of extraversion. 2 introvert utterances and
2 extravert utterances were generated for each con-
tent plan (80 in total) using the parameter values
in Table 2. Multiple outputs were generated with
both parameter settings normally distributed with a
15% standard deviation. Second, 8 utterances for
each content plan (160 in total) were generated with
random parameter values. These random utterances
make it possible to: (1) improve PERSONAGE’s di-
rect output by calibrating its parameters more pre-
cisely; and (2) build a statistical model that selects
utterances matching input personality values after an
overgeneration phase (see Section 6.2). The inter-
rater agreement for extraversion between the judges
over all 240 utterances (average Pearson’s correla-
tion of 0.57) shows that the magnitude of the differ-
ences of perception between judges is almost con-
stant (σ = .037). A low agreement can yield a high
correlation (e.g. if all values differ by a constant
factor), so we also compute the intraclass correla-
tion coefficient r based on a two-way random effect
model. We obtain a r of 0.79, which is significant
at the p < .001 level (reliability of average mea-
sures, identical to Cronbach’s alpha). This is com-
parable to the agreement of judgments of personality
in Mehl et al. (2006) (mean r = 0.84).

6 Experimental Results

6.1 Hypothesized parameter settings

Table 1 provides examples of PERSONAGE’s out-
put and extraversion ratings. To assess whether
PERSONAGE generates language that can be rec-
ognized as introvert and extravert, we did a indepen-
dent sample t-test between the average ratings of the
40 introvert and 40 extravert utterances (parameters
with 15% standard deviation as in Table 2). Table 3

Rating Introvert Extravert Random
Extraversion 2.96 5.98 5.02
Naturalness 4.93 5.78 4.51

Table 3: Average extraversion and naturalness rat-
ings for the utterances generated with introvert, ex-
travert, and random parameters.

shows that introvert utterances have an average rat-
ing of 2.96 out of 7 while extravert utterances have
an average rating of 5.98. These ratings are signifi-
cantly different at the p < .001 level (two-tailed).
In addition, if we divide the data into two equal-
width bins around the neutral extravert rating (4 out
of 7), then PERSONAGE’s utterance ratings fall in
the bin predicted by the parameter set 89.2% of the
time. Extravert utterance are also slightly more nat-
ural than the introvert ones (p < .001).

Table 3 also shows that the 160 random parame-
ter utterances produce an average extraversion rating
of 5.02, both significantly higher than the introvert
set and lower than the extravert set (p < .001). In-
terestingly, the random utterances, which may com-
bine linguistic variables associated with both intro-
verts and extraverts, are less natural than the intro-
vert (p = .059) and extravert sets (p < .001).

6.2 Statistical models evaluation

We also investigate a second approach: overgener-
ation with random parameter settings, followed by
ranking via a statistical model trained on the judges’
feedback. This approach supports generating utter-
ances for any input extraversion value, as well as de-
termining which parameters affect the judges’ per-
ception.

We model perceived personality ratings (1 . . . 7)
with regression models from the Weka toolbox (Wit-
ten and Frank, 2005). We used the full dataset of
160 averaged ratings for the random parameter utter-
ances. Each utterance was associated with a feature
vector with the generation decisions for each param-
eter in Section 2. To reduce data sparsity, we select
features that correlate significantly with the ratings
(p < .10) with a coefficient higher than 0.1.

Regression models are evaluated using the mean
absolute error and the correlation between the pre-
dicted score and the actual average rating. Table 4
shows the mean absolute error on a scale from 1 to
7 over ten 10-fold cross-validations for the 4 best
regression models: Linear Regression (LR), M5’
model tree (M5), and Support Vector Machines (i.e.
SMOreg) with linear kernels (SMO1) and radial-

501



basis function kernels (SMOr). All models signif-
icantly outperform the baseline (0.83 mean absolute
error, p < .05), but surprisingly the linear model
performs the best with a mean absolute error of 0.65.
The best model produces a correlation coefficient of
0.59 with the judges’ ratings, which is higher than
the correlations between pairs of judges, suggesting
that the model performs as well as a human judge.

Metric LR M5 SMO1 SMOr
Absolute error 0.65 0.66 0.72 0.70
Correlation 0.59 0.56 0.54 0.57

Table 4: Mean absolute regression errors (scale from
1 to 7) and correlation coefficients over ten 10-fold
cross-validations, for 4 models: Linear Regression
(LR), M5’ model tree (M5), Support Vector Ma-
chines with linear kernels (SMO1) and radial-basis
function kernels (SMOr). All models significantly
outperform the mean baseline (0.83 error, p < .05).

The M5’ regression tree in Figure 2 assigns a rat-
ing given the features. Verbosity plays the most im-
portant role: utterances with 4 or more content items
are modeled as more extravert. Given a low ver-
bosity, lexical frequency and restatements determine
the extraversion level, e.g. utterances with less than
4 content items and infrequent words are perceived
as very introverted (rating of 2.69 out of 7). For
verbose utterances, the you know hedge indicates
extraversion, as well as concessions, restatements,
self-references, and positive content. Although rel-
atively simple, these models are useful for identify-
ing new personality markers, as well as calibrating
parameters in the direct generation model.

7 Discussion and Conclusions
We present and evaluate PERSONAGE, a parame-
terizable generator that produces outputs that vary
along the extraversion personality dimension. This
paper makes four contributions:

1. We present a systematic review of psycholinguistic find-
ings, organized by the NLG reference architecture;

2. We propose a mapping from these findings to generation
parameters for each NLG module and a real-time imple-
mentation of a generator using these parameters2. To our
knowledge this is the first attempt to put forward a sys-
tematic framework for generating language that manifests
personality;

3. We present an evaluation experiment showing that we can
control the parameters to produce recognizable linguis-
tic variation along the extraversion personality dimen-
sion. Thus, we show that the weak correlations reported

in other genres of language, and for self-reports rather
than observers, carry over to the production of single eval-
uative utterances with recognizable personality in a re-
stricted domain;

4. We present the results of a training experiment showing
that given an output, we can train a model that matches
human performance in assigning an extraversion rating to
that output.

Some of the challenges discussed in the introduc-
tion remain. We have shown that evaluative utter-
ances in the restaurant domain can manifest person-
ality, but more research is needed on which speech
acts recognisably manifest personality in a restricted
domain. We also showed that the mapping we hy-
pothesised of findings to generation parameters was
effective, but there may be additional parameters
that the psycholinguistic findings could be mapped
to.

Our work was partially inspired by the ICONO-
CLAST and PAULINE parameterizable generators
(Bouayad-Agha et al., 2000; Hovy, 1988), which
vary the style, rather than the personality, of the gen-
erated texts. Walker et al. (1997) describe a gen-
erator intended to affect perceptions of personality,
based on Brown and Levinson’s theory of polite-
ness (Brown and Levinson, 1987), that uses some
of the linguistic constructions implemented here,
such as tag questions and hedges, but it was never
evaluated. Research by André et al. (2000); Piwek
(2003) uses personality variables to affect the lin-
guistic behaviour of conversational agents, but they
did not systematically manipulate parameters, and
their generators were not evaluated. Reeves and
Nass (1996) demonstrate that manipulations of per-
sonality affect many aspects of user’s perceptions,
but their experiments use handcrafted utterances,
rather than generated utterances. Cassell and Bick-
more (2003) show that extraverts prefer systems uti-
lizing discourse plans that include small talk. Paiva
and Evans’ trainable generator (2005) produces out-
puts that correspond to a set of linguistic variables
measured in a corpus of target texts. Their method
is similar to our statistical method using regression
trees, but provides direct control. The method re-
ported in Mairesse and Walker (2005) for training
individualized sentence planners ranks the outputs
produced by an overgeneration phase, rather than di-
rectly predicting a scalar value, as we do here. The
closest work to ours is probably Isard et al.’s CRAG-
2 system (2006), which overgenerates and ranks us-
ing ngram language models trained on a corpus la-
belled for all Big Five personality dimensions. How-
ever, CRAG-2 has no explicit parameter control, and
it has yet to be evaluated.

In future work, we hope to directly compare the
direct generation method of Section 6.1 with the
overgenerate and rank method of Section 6.2, and to
use these results to refine PERSONAGE’s parame-
ter settings. We also hope to extend PERSONAGE’s
generation capabilities to other Big Five traits, iden-
tify additional features to improve the model’s per-
formance, and evaluate the effect of personality vari-
ation on user satisfaction in various applications.
