Abstract

Topical blog post retrieval is the task of rank-
ing blog posts with respect to their relevance
for a given topic. To improve topical blog post
retrieval we incorporate textual credibility in-
dicators in the retrieval process. We consider
two groups of indicators: post level (deter-
mined using information about individual blog
posts only) and blog level (determined using
information from the underlying blogs). We
describe how to estimate these indicators and
how to integrate them into a retrieval approach
based on language models. Experiments on
the TREC Blog track test set show that both
groups of credibility indicators significantly
improve retrieval effectiveness; the best per-
formance is achieved when combining them.

1 Introduction

The growing amount of user generated content avail-
able online creates new challenges for the informa-
tion retrieval (IR) community, in terms of search and
analysis tasks for this type of content. The introduc-
tion of a blog retrieval track at TREC (Ounis et al.,
2007) has created a platform where we can begin to
address these challenges. During the 2006 edition
of the track, two types of blog post retrieval were
considered: topical (retrieve posts about a topic)
and opinionated (retrieve opinionated posts about a
topic). Here, we consider the former task.

Blogs and blog posts offer unique features that
may be exploited for retrieval purposes. E.g.,
Mishne (2007b) incorporates time in a blog post
retrieval model to account for the fact that many
blog queries and posts are a response to a news
event (Mishne and de Rijke, 2006). Data quality
is an issue with blogs—the quality of posts ranges
from low to edited news article-like. Some ap-
proaches to post retrieval use indirect quality mea-

sures (e.g., elaborate spam filtering (Java et al.,
2007) or counting inlinks (Mishne, 2007a)).

Few systems turn the credibility (Metzger, 2007)
of blog posts into an aspect that can benefit the re-
trieval process. Our hypothesis is that more credible
blog posts are preferred by searchers. The idea of us-
ing credibility in the blogosphere is not new: Rubin
and Liddy (2006) define a framework for assessing
blog credibility, consisting of four main categories:
blogger’s expertise and offline identity disclosure;
blogger’s trustworthiness and value system; infor-
mation quality; and appeals and triggers of a per-
sonal nature. Under these four categories the authors
list a large number of indicators, some of which can
be determined from textual sources (e.g., literary ap-
peal), and some of which typically need non-textual
evidence (e.g., curiosity trigger); see Section 2.

We give concrete form to Rubin and Liddy
(2006)’s indicators and test their impact on blog post
retrieval effectiveness. We do not consider all indi-
cators: we only consider indicators that are textual in
nature, and to ensure reproducibility of our results,
we only consider indicators that can be derived from
the TRECBlog06 corpus (and that do not need addi-
tional resources such as bloggers’ profiles that may
be hard to obtain for technical or legal reasons).

We detail and implement two groups of credibility
indicators: post level (these use information about
individual posts) and blog level (these use informa-
tion from the underlying blogs). Within the post
level group, we distinguish between topic depen-
dent and independent indicators. To make matters
concrete, consider Figure 1: both posts are relevant
to the query “tennis,” but based on obvious surface
level features of the posts we quickly determine Post
2 to be more credible than Post 1. The most obvious
features are spelling errors, the lack of leading capi-
tals, and the large number of exclamation marks and

as for today (monday) we had no school! yaay
labor day. but we had tennis from 9-11 at the
highschool. after that me suzi melis & ashley
had a picnic at cecil park and then played ten-

very very fun afternoon. (...) we will have a

personal pronouns—i.e., topic independent ones—
and the fact that the language usage in the second
post is more easily associated with credible infor-
mation about tennis than the language usage in the
first post—i.e., a topic dependent feature.

Our main finding is that topical blog post retrieval
can benefit from using credibility indicators in the
retrieval process. Both post and blog level indi-
cator groups each show a significant improvement
over the baseline. When we combine all features
we obtain the best retrieval performance, and this
performance is comparable to the best performing
TREC 2006 and 2007 Blog track participants. The
improvement over the baseline is stable across most
topics, although topic shift occurs in a few cases.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In
Section 2 we provide information on determining
credibility; we also relate previous work to the cred-
ibility indicators that we consider. Section 3 speci-
fies our retrieval model, a method for incorporating
credibility indicators in our retrieval model, and es-
timations of credibility indicators. Section 4 gives
the results of our experiments aimed at assessing
the contribution of credibility towards blog post re-
trieval effectiveness. We conclude in Section 5.

2 Credibility Indicators

In our choice of credibility indicators we use (Ru-
bin and Liddy, 2006)’s work as a reference point.
We recall the main points of their framework and
relate our indicators to it. We briefly discuss other
credibility-related indicators found in the literature.

2.1 Rubin and Liddy (2006)’s work

Rubin and Liddy (2006) proposed a four factor an-
alytical framework for blog-readers’ credibility as-
sessment of blog sites, based in part on evidential-
ity theory (Chafe, 1986), website credibility assess-
ment surveys (Stanford et al., 2002), and Van House
(2004)’s observations on blog credibility. The four
factors—plus indicators for each of them—are:

1. blogger’s expertise and offline identity disclo-
sure (a: name and geographic location; b: cre-
dentials; c: affiliations; d: hyperlinks to others;
e: stated competencies; f : mode of knowing);

2. blogger’s trustworthiness and value system (a:
biases; b: beliefs; c: opinions; d: honesty; e:
preferences; f : habits; g: slogans)

3. information quality (a: completeness; b: ac-
curacy; c: appropriateness; d: timeliness; e:
organization (by categories or chronology); f :
match to prior expectations; g: match to infor-
mation need); and

4. appeals and triggers of a personal nature (a:
aesthetic appeal; b: literary appeal (i.e., writing
style); c: curiosity trigger; d: memory trigger;
e: personal connection).

2.2 Our credibility indicators

We only consider credibility indicators that avoid
making use of the searcher’s or blogger’s identity
(i.e., excluding 1a, 1c, 1e, 1f, 2e from Rubin and
Liddy’s list), that can be estimated automatically
from available test collections only so as to facilitate
repeatability of our experiments (ruling out 3e, 4a,
4c, 4d, 4e), that are textual in nature (ruling out 2d),
and that can be reliably estimated with state-of-the-
art language technology (ruling out 2a, 2b, 2c, 2g).
For reasons that we explain below, we also ignore
the “hyperlinks to others” indicator (1d).

The indicators that we do consider—1b, 2f, 3a,
3b, 3c, 3d, 3f, 3g, 4b—are organized in two groups,

924



depending on the information source that we use
to estimate them, post level and blog level, and the
former is further subdivided into topic independent
and topic dependent. Table 1 lists the indicators we
consider, together with the corresponding Rubin and
Liddy indicator(s).

Let us quickly explain our indicators. First, we
consider the use of capitalization to be an indicator
of good writing style, which in turn contributes to
a sense of credibility. Second, we identify West-
ern style emoticons (e.g., :-) and :-D) in blog
posts, and assume that excessive use indicates a less
credible blog post. Third, words written in all caps
are considered shouting in a web environment; we
consider shouting to be indicative for non-credible
posts. Fourth, a credible author should be able to
write without (a lot of) spelling errors; the more
spelling errors occur in a blog post, the less credi-
ble we consider it to be. Fifth, we assume that cred-
ible texts have a reasonable length; the text should
supply enough information to convince the reader of
the author’s credibility. Sixth, assuming that much
of what goes on in the blogosphere is inspired by
events in the news (Mishne and de Rijke, 2006), we
believe that, for news related topics, a blog post is
more credible if it is published around the time of
the triggering news event (timeliness). Seventh, our
semantic indicator also exploits the news-related na-
ture of many blog posts, and “prefers” posts whose
language usage is similar to news stories on the
topic. Eighth, blogs are a popular place for spam-
mers; spam blogs are not considered credible and we
want to demote them in the search results. Ninth,
comments are a notable blog feature: readers of a
blog post often have the possibility of leaving a com-
ment for other readers or the author. When peo-
ple comment on a blog post they apparently find the
post worth putting effort in, which can be seen as an
indicator of credibility (Mishne and Glance, 2006).
Tenth, blogs consist of multiple posts in (reverse)
chronological order. The temporal aspect of blogs
may indicate credibility: we assume that bloggers
with an irregular posting behavior are less credible
than bloggers who post regularly. And, finally, we
consider the topical fluctuation of a blogger’s posts.
When looking for credible information we would
like to retrieve posts from bloggers that have a cer-
tain level of (topical) consistency: not the fluctuating

indicator topic de- post level/ related Rubin &
pendent? blog level Liddy indicator

behavior of a (personal) blogger, but a solid interest.

2.3 Other work

In a web setting, credibility is often couched in
terms of authoritativeness and estimated by exploit-
ing the hyperlink structure. Two well-known exam-
ples are the PageRank and HITS algorithms (Liu,
2007), that use the link structure in a topic indepen-
dent or topic dependent way, respectively. Zhou and
Croft (2005) propose collection-document distance
and signal-to-noise ratio as priors for the indication
of quality in web ad hoc retrieval. The idea of using
link structure for improving blog post retrieval has
been researched, but results do not show improve-
ments. E.g., Mishne (2007a) finds that retrieval per-
formance decreased. This confirms lessons from
the TREC web tracks, where participants found no
conclusive benefit from the use of link information
for ad hoc retrieval tasks (Hawking and Craswell,
2002). Hence, we restrict ourselves to the use of
content-based features for blog post retrieval, thus
ignoring indicator 1d (hyperlinks to others).

Related to credibility in blogs is the automatic as-
sessment of forum post quality discussed by Weimer
et al. (2007). The authors use surface, lexical, syn-
tactic and forum-specific features to classify forum
posts as bad posts or good posts. The use of forum-
specific features (such as whether or not the post
contains HTML, and the fraction of characters that
are inside quotes of other posts), gives the highest
benefits to the classification. Working in the com-
munity question/answering domain, Agichtein et al.
(2008) use a content features, as well non-content in-
formation available, such as links between items and

925



explicit quality ratings from members of the com-
munity to identify high-quality content.

As we argued above, spam identification may be
part of estimating a blog (or blog post’s) credibility.
Spam identification has been successfully applied in
the blogosphere to improve retrieval effectiveness;
see, e.g., (Mishne, 2007b; Java et al., 2007).

3 Modeling

In this section we detail the retrieval model that we
use, incorporating ranking by relevance and by cred-
ibility. We also describe how we estimate the credi-
bility indicators listed in Section 2.

3.1 Baseline retrieval model

We address the baseline retrieval task using a
language modeling approach (Croft and Lafferty,
2003), where we rank documents given a query:
p(d|q) = p(d)p(q|d)p(q)−1. Using Bayes’ Theo-
rem we rewrite this, ignoring expressions that do not
influence the ranking, obtaining

p(d|q) ∝ p(d)p(q|d), (1)

and, assuming that query terms are independent,

p(d|q) ∝ p(d)
∏

t∈q p(t|θd)
n(t,q), (2)

where θd is the blog post model, and n(t, q) denotes
the number of times term t occurs in query q. To
prevent numerical underflows, we perform this com-
putation in the log domain:

log p(d|q) ∝ log p(d) +
∑
t∈q

n(t, q) log p(t|θd) (3)

In our final formula for ranking posts based on rel-
evance only we substitute n(t, q) by the probability
of the term given the query. This allows us to assign
different weights to query terms and yields:

log p(d|q) ∝ log p(d) +
∑
t∈q

p(t|q) log p(t|θd). (4)

For our baseline experiments we assume that all
query terms are equally important and set p(t|q) set
to be n(t, q) · |q|−1. The component p(d) is the topic
independent (“prior”) probability that the document
is relevant; in the baseline model, priors are ignored.

3.2 Incorporating credibility

Next, we extend Eq. 4 by incorporating estimations
of the credibility indicators listed in Table 1. Recall
that our credibility indicators come in two kinds—
post level and blog level—and that the post level
indicators can be topic indepedent or topic depen-
dent, while all blog level indicators are topic inde-
pendent. Now, modeling topic independent indi-
cators is easy—they can simply be incorporated in
Eq. 4 as a weighted sum of two priors:

p(d) = λ · ppl(d) + (1− λ) · pbl(d), (5)

where ppl(d) and pbl(d) are the post level and blog
level prior probability of d, respectively. The priors
ppl and pbl are defined as equally weighted sums:

ppl(d) =
∑

i
1
5
· pi(d)

pbl(d) =
∑

j
1
4
· pj(d),

where i ∈ {capitalization, emoticons, shouting,
spelling, post length} and j ∈ {spam, comments,
regularity, consistency}. Estimations of the priors
pi and pj are given below; the weighting parameter
λ is determined experimentally.

Modeling topic dependent indicators is slighty
more involved. Given a query q, we create a query
model θq that is a mixture of a temporal query model
θtemporal and a semantic query model θsemantic:

p(t|θq) = (6)
µ · p(t|θtemporal) + (1− µ) · p(t|θsemantic).

The component models θtemporal and θsemantic will
be estimated below; the parameter µ will be esti-
mated experimentally.

Our final ranking formula, then, is obtained by
plugging in Eq. 5 and 6 in Eq. 4:

log p(d|q) ∝ log p(d)
+ β (

∑
t p(t|q) · log p(t|θd)) (7)

+ (1− β) (
∑

t p(t|θq) · log p(t|θd)) .

3.3 Estimating credibility indicators

Next, we specify how each of the credibility indica-
tors is estimated; we do so in two groups: post level
and blog level.

926



3.3.1 Post level credibility indicators
Capitalization We estimate the capitalization
prior as follows:

pcapitalization(d) = n(c, s) · |s|−1, (8)

where n(c, s) is the number of sentences starting
with a capital and |s| is the number of sentences;
we only consider sentences with five or more words.

Emoticons The emoticons prior is estimated as

pemoticons(d) = 1− n(e, d) · |d|−1, (9)

where n(e, d) is the number of emoticons in the post
and |d| is the length of the post in words.

Shouting We use the following equation to esti-
mate the shouting prior:

pshouting(d) = 1− n(a, d) · |d|−1, (10)

where n(a, d) is the number of all caps words in blog
post d and |d| is the post length in words.

Spelling The spelling prior is estimated as

pspelling(d) = 1− n(m, d) · |d|−1, (11)

where n(m, d) is the number of misspelled (or un-
known) words and |d| is the post length in words.

Post length The post length prior is estimated us-
ing |d|, the post length in words:

plength(d) = log(|d|). (12)

Timeliness We estimate timeliness using the time-
based language models θtemporal proposed in (Li
and Croft, 2003; Mishne, 2007b). I.e., we use a news
corpus from the same period as the blog corpus that
we use for evaluation purposes (see Section 4.2). We
assign a timeliness score per post based on:

p(d|θtemporal) = k−1 · (n(date(d), k) + 1) , (13)

where k is the number of top results from the initial
result list, date(d) is the date associated with doc-
ument d, and n(date(d), k) is the number of docu-
ments in k with the same date as d. For our initial
result list we perform retrieval on both the blog and
the news corpus and take k = 50 for both corpora.

Semantic A semantic query model θsemantic is
obtained using ideas due to Diaz and Metzler (2006).
Again, we use a news corpus from the same period
as the evaluation blog corpus and estimate θsemantic.
We issue the query to the external news corpus, re-
trieve the top 10 documents and extract the top 10
distinctive terms from these documents. These terms
are added to the original query terms to capture the
language usage around the topic.

3.3.2 Blog level credibility indicators
Spam filtering To estimate the spaminess of a
blog, we take a simple approach. We train an SVM
classifier on a labeled splog blog dataset (Kolari
et al., 2006) using the top 1500 words for both spam
and non-spam blogs as features. For each classified
blog d we have a confidence value s(d). If the clas-
sifier cannot make a decision (s(d) = 0) we set
pspam(d) to 0, otherwise we use the following to
transform s(d) into a spam prior pspam(d):

pspam(d) =
s(d)

2|s(d)|
+

−1 · s(d)
2s(d)2 + 2|s(d)|

+
1
2
. (14)

Comments We estimate the comment prior as

pcomment(d) = log(n(r, d)), (15)

where n(r, d) is the number of comments on post d.

Regularity To estimate the regularity prior we use

pregularity(d) = log(σinterval), (16)

where σinterval expresses the standard deviation of
the temporal intervals between two successive posts.

Topical consistency Here we use an approach
similar to query clarity (Cronen-Townsend and
Croft, 2002): based on the list of posts from the
same blog we compare the topic distribution of blog
B to the topic distribution in the collection C and
assign a ‘clarity’ value to B; a score further away
from zero indicates a higher topical consistency. We
estimate the topical consistency prior as

ptopic(d) = log(clarity(d)), (17)

where clarity(d) is estimated by

clarity(d) =

∑
w p(w|B) · log

(
p(w|B)
p(w)

)
∑

w p(w|B)
(18)

with p(w) = count(w,C)|C| and p(w|B) =
count(w,B)
|B| .

927



3.3.3 Efficiency
All estimators discussed above can be imple-

mented efficiently: most are document priors and
can therefore be calculated offline. The only topic
dependent estimators are timeliness and language
usage; both can be implemented efficiently as spe-
cific forms of query expansion.

4 Evaluation

In this section we describe the experiments we con-
ducted to answer our research questions about the
impact of credibility on blog post retrieval.

4.1 Research questions

Our research revolves around the contribution of
credibility to the effectiveness of topical blog post
retrieval: what is the contribution of individual indi-
cators, of the post level indicators (topic dependent
or independent), of the blog level indicators, and of
all indicators combined? And do different topics
benefit from different indicators? To answer our re-
search question we compared the performance of the
baseline retrieval system (as detailed in Section 3.1)
with extensions of the baseline system with a single
indicator, a set of indicators, or all indicators.

4.2 Setup

We apply our models to the TREC Blog06 cor-
pus (Macdonald and Ounis, 2006). This corpus
has been constructed by monitoring around 100,000
blog feeds for a period of 11 weeks in early 2006,
downloading all posts created in this period. For
each permalink (HTML page containing one blog
post) the feed id is registered. We can use this id
to aggregate post level features to the blog level. In
our experiments we use only the HTML documents,
3.2M permalinks, which add up to around 88 GB.

The TREC 2006 and 2007 Blog tracks each offer
50 topics and assessments (Ounis et al., 2007; Mac-
donald et al., 2007). For topical relevancy, assess-
ment was done using a standard two-level scale: the
content of the post was judged to be topically rele-
vant or not. The evaluation metrics that we use are
standard ones: mean average precision (MAP) and
precision@10 (p@10) (Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-
Neto, 1999). For all our retrieval tasks we use the
title field (T) of the topic statement as query.

To estimate the timeliness and semantic cred-
ibility indicators, we use AQUAINT-2, a set of
newswire articles (2.5 GB, about 907K documents)
that are roughly contemporaneous with the TREC
Blog06 collection (AQUAINT-2, 2007). Articles are
in English and come from a variety of sources.

Statistical significance is tested using a two-tailed
paired t-test. Significant improvements over the
baseline are marked with M (α = 0.05) or N (α =
0.01). We use O and H for a drop in performance
(for α = 0.05 and α = 0.01, respectively).

4.3 Parameter estimation

The models proposed in Section 3.2 contain param-
eters β, λ and µ. These parameters need to be esti-
mated and, hence, require a training and test set. We
use a two-fold parameter estimation process: in the
first cycle we estimate the parameters on the TREC
2006 Blog topic set and test these settings on the top-
ics of the TREC 2007 Blog track. The second cycle
goes the other way around and trains on the 2007
set, while testing on the 2006 set.

Figure 2 shows the optimum values for λ, β, and
µ on the 2006 and the 2007 topic sets for both MAP
(bottom lines) and p@10 (top lines). When look-
ing at the MAP scores, the optimal setting for λ is
almost identical for the two topic sets: 0.4 for the
2006 set and 0.3 for the 2007 set, and also the op-
timal setting for β is very similar for both sets: 0.4
for the 2006 set and 0.5 for the 2007 set. As to µ,
it is clear that timeliness does not improve the per-
formance over using the semantic feature alone and
the optimal setting for µ is therefore 0.0. Both µ
and β show similar behavior on p@10 as on MAP,
but for λ we see a different trend. If early precision
is required, the value of λ should be increased, giv-
ing more weight to the topic-independent post level
features compared to the blog level features.

4.4 Retrieval performance

Table 2 lists the retrieval results for the baseline, for
each of the credibility indicators (on top of the base-
line), for four subsets of indicators, and for all in-
dicators combined. The baseline performs similar
to the median scores at the TREC 2006 Blog track
(MAP: 0.2203; p@10: 0.564) and somewhat below
the median MAP score at 2007 Blog track (MAP:
0.3340) but above the median p@10 score: 0.3805.

using λ = 0.3, β = 0.4, and µ = 0.0.

Some (topic independent) post level indicators
hurt the MAP score, while others help (for both
years, and both measures). Combined, the topic
independent post level indicators perform less well
than the use of one of them (post length). As to
the topic dependent post level indicators, timeliness
hurts performance on MAP for both years, while
the semantic indicator provides significant improve-
ments across the board (resulting in a top 2 score in
terms of MAP and a top 5 score in terms of p@10,
when compared to the TREC 2006 Blog track par-
ticipants that only used the T field).

Some of the blog level features hurt more than
they help (regularity, consistency), while the com-
ments feature helps, on all measures, and for both
years. Combined, the blog level features help less

than the use of one of them (comments).
As a group, the combined post level features help

more than either of the two post level sub groups
alone. The blog level features show similar results to
the topic-independent post level features, obtaining
a significant increase on both MAP and p@10, but
lower than the topic-dependent post level features.

The grand combination of all credibility indica-
tors leads to a significant improvement over any of
the single indicators and over any of the four subsets
considered in Table 2. The MAP score of this run
is higher than the best performing run in the TREC
2006 Blog track and has a top 3 performance on
p@10; its 2007 performance is just within the top
half on both MAP and p@10.

4.5 Analysis

Next we examine the differences in average preci-
sion (per topic) between the baseline and subsets of
indicators (post and blog level) and the grand com-
bination. We limit ourselves to an analysis of the
MAP scores. Figure 3 displays the per topic average
precision scores, where topics are sorted by absolute
gain of the grand combination over the baseline.

In 2006, 7 (out of 50) topics were negatively af-
fected by the use of credibility indicators; in 2007,
15 (out of 50) were negatively affected. Table 3 lists
the topics that displayed extreme behavior (in terms
of relative performance gain or drop in AP score).
While the extreme drops for both years are in the
same range, the gains for 2006 are more extreme
than for 2007.

The topic that is hurt most (in absolute terms)
by the credibility indicators is the 2007 topic 910:
aperto network (AP -0.2781). The semantic indi-
cator is to blame for this decrease is: the terms in-
cluded in the expanded query shift the topic from a
wireless broadband provider to television networks.

2006

866 foods +446.2%
865 basque +308.6%
862 blackberry -21.5%
870 barry bonds -35.2%
898 business intelligence resources -78.8%

945 bolivia +125.5%
943 censure -49.4%
928 big love -80.0%
904 alterman -84.2%

Topics that gain most (in absolute terms) are 947
(sasha cohen; AP +0.3809) and 923 (challenger; AP
+0.3622) from the 2007 topic set.

Finally, the combination of all credibility indica-
tors hurts 7 (2006) plus 15 (2007) equals 22 topics;
for the post level indicators get a performance drop
in AP for 28 topics (10 plus 18, respectively) and for
the blog level indicators we get a drop for 15 topics
(4 plus 11, respectively). Hence, the combination of
all indicators strikes a good balance between overall
performance gain and per topic risk.

5 Conclusions

We provided efficient estimations for 11 credibility
indicators and assessed their impact on topical blog
post retrieval, on top of a content-based retrieval

baseline. We compared the contribution of these in-
dicators, both individually and in groups, and found
that (combined) they have a significant positive im-
pact on topical blog post retrieval effectiveness. Cer-
tain single indicators, like post length and comments,
make good credibility indicators on their own; the
best performing credibility indicator group consists
of topic dependent post level ones. Other future
work concerns indicator selection: instead of taking
all indicators on board, consider selected indicators
only, in a topic dependent fashion.

Our choice of credibility indicators was based on
a framework proposed by Rubin and Liddy (2006):
the estimators we used are natural implementations
of the selected indicators, but by no means the only
possible ones. In future work we intend to extend
the set of indicators considered so as to include, e.g.,
stated competencies (1e), by harvesting and analyz-
ing bloggers’ profiles, and to extend the set of esti-
mators for indicators that we already consider such
as reading level measures (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid) for
the literary appeal indicator (4b).
