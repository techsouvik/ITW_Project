Abstract

This paper presents an approach to text cate-
gorization that i) uses no machine learning and
ii) reacts on-the-fly to unknown words. These
features are important for categorizing Blog
articles, which are updated on a daily basis
and filled with newly coined words. We cat-
egorize 600 Blog articles into 12 domains. As
a result, our categorization method achieved
an accuracy of 94.0% (564/600).

1 Introduction

This paper presents a simple but high-performance
method for text categorization. The method assigns
domain tags to words in an article, and categorizes
the article as the most dominant domain. In this
study, the 12 domains in Table 1 are used follow-
ing (Hashimoto and Kurohashi, 2007) (H&K here-
after)1. Fundamental words are assigned with a do-

main tag by H&K’s domain dictionary, while the
domains of non-fundamental words (i.e. unknown
words) are dynamically estimated, which makes the
method different from previous ones. Another hall-
mark of the method is that it requires no machine

no particular domain like blue or people.

learning. All you need is the domain dictionary and
the access to the Web.

2 The Domain Dictionary

H&K constructed a domain dictionary, where about
30,000 Japanese fundamental content words (JFWs)
are associated with appropriate domains. For exam-
ple, homer is associated with SPORTS.

2.1 Construction Process

1 Preparing Keywords for each Domain About
20 keywords for each domain were collected manu-
ally from words that appear frequently in the Web.
They represent the contents of domains.

2 Associating JFWs with Domains A JFW is
associated with a domain of the highest Ad score.
An Ad score of domain is calculated by summing
up the top five Ak scores of the domain. Then,
an Ak score, which is defined between a JFW and
a keyword of a domain, is a measure that shows
how strongly the JFW and the keyword are related.
H&K adopt the χ2 statistics to calculate an Ak score
and use web pages as a corpus. The number of
co-occurrences is approximated by the number of
search engine hits when the two words are used as
queries. Ak score between a JFW (jw) and a key-
word (kw) is given as below.

Ak(jw, kw) =
n(ad− bc)2

(a + b)(c + d)(a + c)(b + d)
(1)

where n is the total number of Japanese web pages,

a = hits(jw & kw), b = hits(jw) − a,
c = hits(kw) − a, d = n− (a + b + c).

69



Note that hits(q) represents the number of search
engine hits when q is used as a query.

3 Manual Correction Manual correction of the
automatic association2 is done to complete the dic-
tionary. Since the accuracy of 2 is 81.3%, manual
correction is not time-consuming.

2.2 Distinctive Features

H&K’s method is independent of what domains to
assume. You can create your own dictionary. All
you need is prepare keywords of your own domains.
After that, the same construction process is applied.

Also note that H&K’s method requires no text col-
lection that is typically used for machine learning
techniques. All you need is the access to the Web.

3 Blog Categorization

The categorization proceeds as follows: 1 Extract
words from an article, 2 Assign domains and IDFs
to the words, 3 Sum up IDFs for each domain, 4
Categorize the article as the domain of the highest
IDF.3 As for 2 , the IDF is calculated as follows:4

IDF(w) = log
Total # of Japanese web pages

# of hits of w
(2)

Fundamental words are assigned with their do-
mains and IDFs by the domain dictionary, while
those for unknown words are dynamically estimated
by the method described in §4.

4 Domain Estimation of Unknown Words

The domain (and IDF) of unknown word is dynam-
ically estimated exploiting the Web. More specifi-
cally, we use Wikipedia and Snippets of Web search,
in addition to the domain dictionary. The estimation
proceeds as follows (Figure 1): 1 Search the Web
with an unknown word, acquire the top 100 records,
and calculate the IDF. 2 Get the Wikipedia article
about the word from the search result if any, estimate
the domain of the word with the Wikipedia-strict
module (§4.1), and exit. 3 When no Wikipedia arti-
cle about the word is found, then get any Wikipedia

2In H&K’s method, reassociating JFWs with NODOMAIN is
required before 3 . We omit that due to the space limitation.

3If the domain of the highest IDF is NODOMAIN, the article
is categorized as the second highest domain.

4We used 10,000,000,000 as the total number.

in the top 30 of the search result, then remove all
corporate snippets. 5 Estimate the domain with the
Snippets module (§4.2) if any snippet is left in the
search result, and exit. 6 If no snippet is left but the
unknown word is a compound word containing fun-
damental words, then estimate the domain with the
Components module (§4.3), and exit. 7 If no snip-
pet is left and the word does not contain fundamental
words, then the estimation is a failure.

4.1 Wikipedia(-strict|-loose) Module

The two Wikipedia modules take the following pro-
cedure: 1 Extract only fundamental words from the
Wikipedia article. 2 Assign domains and IDFs to
the words using the domain dictionary. 3 Sum up
IDFs for each domain. 4 Assign the domain of the
highest IDF to the unknown word. If the domain
is NODOMAIN, the second highest domain is chosen
for the unknown word under the condition below:

70



Second-highest-IDF/ NODOMAIN’s-IDF>0.15

4.2 Snippets Module

The Snippets module takes as input the snippets that
are left in the search result after removing those
of corporate web sites. We remove snippets in
which corporate keywords like sales appear more
than once. The keywords were collected from the
analysis of our preliminary experiments. Remov-
ing corporate snippets is indispensable because they
bias the estimation toward BUSINESS. This module
is the same as the Wikipedia modules except that it
extracts fundamental words from residual snippets.

4.3 Components Module

This is basically the same as the others except that it
extracts fundamental words from the unknown word
itself. For example, the domain of finance market is
estimated from the domains of finance and market.

5 Evaluation

5.1 Experimental Condition

Data We categorized 600 Blog articles from Ya-
hoo! Blog (blogs.yahoo.co.jp) into the 12 do-
mains (50 articles for each domain). In Yahoo! Blog,
articles are manually classified into Yahoo! Blog cat-
egories (' domains) by authors of the articles.

Evaluation Method We measured the accuracy of
categorization and the domain estimation. In cate-
gorization, we tried three kinds of words to be ex-
tracted from articles: fundamental words (F only in
Table 3), fundamental and simplex unknown words
(i.e. no compound word) (F+SU), and fundamen-
tal and all unknown words (both simplex and com-
pound, F+AU). Also, we measured the accuracy of
N best outputs (Top N). During the categorization,
about 12,000 unknown words were found in the 600
articles. Then, we sampled 500 estimation results
from them. Table 2 shows the breakdown of the 500
unknown words in terms of their correct domains.
The other 167 words belong to NODOMAIN.

5.2 Result of Blog Categorization

Table 3 shows the accuracy of categorization. The
F only column indicates that a rather simple method
like the one in §3 works well, if fundamental words
are given good clues for categorization: the domain

in our case. This is consistent with Kornai et al.
(2003), who claim that only positive evidence mat-
ter in categorization. Also, F+SU slightly outper-
formed F only, and F+AU outperformed the others.
This shows that the domain estimation of unknown
words moderately improves Blog categorization.

Errors are mostly due to the system’s incorrect fo-
cus on topics of secondary importance. For exam-
ple, in an article on a sightseeing trip, which should
be RECREATION, the author frequently mentions the
means of transportation. As a result, the article was
wrongly categorized as TRAFFIC.

5.3 Result of Domain Estimation

The accuracy of the domain estimation of unknown
words was 77.2% (386/500). Table 4 shows the fre-
quency in use and accuracy for each domain esti-
mation module.5 The Snippets module was used

accuracy of 76%. Though the Wikipedia-strict mod-
ule showed the best performance, it was used not

so often. However, we expect that as the number
of Wikipedia articles increases, the best performing
module will be used more frequently.

An example of newly coined words whose do-
mains were estimated correctly is

�������

�

day-trade.
It was correctly assigned with BUSINESS by the
Wikipedia-loose module.

Errors were mostly due to the subtle boundary be-
tween NODOMAIN and the other particular domains.
For instance, person’s names that are common and
popular should be NODOMAIN. But in most cases
they were associated with some particular domain.
This is due to the fact that virtually any person’s
name is linked to some particular domain in the Web.

6 Related Work

Previous text categorization methods like Joachims
(1999) and Schapire and Singer (2000) are mostly
based on machine learning. Those methods need
huge quantities of training data, which is hard to ob-
tain. Though there has been a growing interest in
semi-supervised learning (Abney, 2007), it is in an
early phase of development.

In contrast, our method requires no training data.
All you need is a manageable amount of fundamen-
tal words with domains. Also note that our method
is NOT tailored to the 12 domains. If you want
your own domains to categorize, it is only neces-
sary to construct your own dictionary, which is also
domain-independent and not time-consuming.

In fact, there have been other proposals without
the burden of preparing training data. Liu et al.
(2004) prepare representative words for each class,
by which they collect initial training data to build
classifier. Ko and Seo (2004) automatically collect
training data using a large amount of unlabeled data
and a small amount of seed information. However,
the novelty of this study is the on-the-fly estimation
of unknown words’ domains. This feature is very
useful for categorizing Blog articles that are updated
on a daily basis and filled with newly coined words.

Domain information has been used for many NLP
tasks. Magnini et al. (2002) show the effectiveness
of domain information for WSD. Piao et al. (2003)
use domain tags to extract MWEs.

Previous domain resources include WordNet

(Fellbaum, 1998) and HowNet (Dong and Dong,
2006), among others. H&K’s dictionary is the first
fully available domain resource for Japanese.

7 Conclusion

This paper presented a text categorization method
that exploits H&K’s domain dictionary and the dy-
namic domain estimation of unknown words. In the
Blog categorization, the method achieved the accu-
racy of 94%, and the domain estimation of unknown
words achieved the accuracy of 77%.
