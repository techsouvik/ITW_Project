Abstract

In this paper we describe recent improvements
to components and methods used in our statis-
tical machine translation system for Chinese-
English used in the January 2008 GALE eval-
uation. Main improvements are results of
consistent data processing, larger statistical
models and a POS-based word reordering ap-
proach.

1 Introduction

Building a full scale Statistical Machine Transla-
tion (SMT) system involves many preparation and
training steps and it consists of several components,
each of which contribute to the overall system per-
formance. Between 2007 and 2008 our system im-
proved by 5 points in BLEU from 26.60 to 31.85
for the unseen MT06 test set, which can be mainly
attributed to two major points.

The fast growth of computing resources over
the years make it possible to use larger and larger
amounts of data in training. In Section 3 we show
how parallelizing model training can reduce training
time by an order of magnitude and how using larger
training data as well as more extensive models im-
prove translation quality.

Word reordering is still a difficult problem in
SMT. In Section 4 we apply a Part Of Speech (POS)
based syntactic reordering model successfully to our
large Chinese system.

1.1 Decoder
Our translation system is based on the CMU
SMT decoder as described in (Hewavitharana et

al., 2005). Our decoder is a phrase-based beam
search decoder, which combines multiple models
e.g. phrase tables, several language models, a dis-
tortion model ect. in a log-linear fashion. In order
to find an optimal set of weights, we use MER train-
ing as described in (Venugopal et al., 2005), which
uses rescoring of the top n hypotheses to maximize
an evaluation metric like BLEU or TER.

1.2 Evaluation

In this paper we report results using the BLEU met-
ric (Papineni et al., 2002), however as the evaluation
criterion in GALE is HTER (Snover et al., 2006), we
also report in TER (Snover et al., 2005).

We used the test sets from the NIST MT evalua-
tions from the years 2003 and 2006 as development
and unseen test data.

1.3 Training Data

In translation model training we used the Chinese-
English bilingual corpora relevant to GALE avail-
able through the LDC1. After sentence alignment
these sources add up to 10.7 million sentences with
301 million running words on the English side. Our
preprocessing steps include tokenization on the En-
glish side and for Chinese: automatic word segmen-
tation using the revised version of the Stanford Chi-
nese Word Segmenter2 (Tseng et al., 2005) from
2007, replacement of traditional by simplified Chi-
nese characters and 2-byte to 1-byte ASCII charac-
ter normalization. After data cleaning steps like e.g.
removal of sentence pairs with very unbalanced sen-

77



tence length etc., we used the remaining 10 million
sentences with 260 million words (English) in trans-
lation model training (260M system).

2 Number Tagging

Systematic tagging and pre-translation of numbers
had shown significant improvements for our Arabic-
English system, so we investigated this for Chinese-
English. The baseline for these experiments was a
smaller system with 67 million words (67M) bilin-
gual training data (English) and a 500 million word
3-gram LM with a BLEU score of 27.61 on MT06.
First we pre-translated all numbers in the testdata
only, thus forcing the decoder to treat the numbers as
unknown words. Probably because the system could
not match longer phrases across the pre-translated
numbers, the overall translation quality degraded by
1.6 BLEU to 26.05 (see Table 1).

We then tagged all numbers in the training corpus,
replaced them with a placeholder tag and re-trained
the translation model. This reduced the vocabu-
lary and enabled the decoder to generalize longer
phrases across numbers. This strategy did not lead to
the expected result, the BLEU score for MT06 only
reached 25.97 BLEU.

System MT03 MT06
67M baseline 31.45/60.93 27.61/62.18
test data tagged – 26.06/63.36
training data tagged 29.07/62.52 25.97/63.39

Table 1: Number tagging experiments, BLEU/TER

Analysing this in more detail, we found, the rea-
son for this degradation in translation quality could
be the unbalanced occurrence of number tags in the
training data. From the bilingual sentence pairs,
which contain number tags, 66.52% do not contain
the same number of tags on the Chinese and the En-
glish side. As a consequence 52% of the phrase pairs
in the phrase table, which contain number tags had
to be removed, because the tags were unbalanced.
This hurts system performance considerably.

3 Scaling up to Large Data

3.1 Language Model
Due to the availability of more computing resources,
we were able to extend the language model history

from 4- to 5-gram, which improved translation qual-
ity from 29.49 BLEU to 30.22 BLEU for our large
scale 260M system (see Table 2). This shows, that
longer LM histories help if we are able to use enough
data in model training.

System MT03 MT06
260M, 4gram 31.20/61.00 29.49/61.00
260M, 5gram 32.20/60.59 30.22/60.81

Table 2: 4- and 5-gram LM,260M system, BLEU/TER

The language model was trained on the sources
from the English Gigaword Corpus V3, which con-
tains several newspapers for the years between 1994
to 2006. We also included the English side of the
bilingual training data, resulting in a total of 2.7 bil-
lion running words after tokenization.

We trained separate open vocabulary language
models for each source and interpolated them using
the SRI Language Modeling Toolkit (Stolcke, 2002).
Table 3 shows the interpolation weights for the dif-
ferent sources. Apart from the English part of the
bilingual data, the newswire data from the Chinese
Xinhua News Agency and the Agence France Press
have the largest weights. This reflects the makeup of
the test data, which comes in large parts from these
sources. Other sources, as for example the UN par-
lamentary speeches or the New York Times, differ
significantly in style and vocabulary from the test
data and therefore get small weights.

3.2 Speeding up Model Training
To accelerate the training of word alignment
models we implemented a distributed version of
GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003), based on the latest
version of GIZA++ and a parallel version developed
at Peking University (Lin et al., 2006). We divide the
bilingual training data in equal parts and distribute it
over several processing nodes, which perform align-
ment independently. In each iteration the nodes read
the model from the previous step and output all nec-
essary counts from the data for the models, e.g. the

78



co-occurrence or fertility model. A master process
collects the counts from the nodes, normalizes them
and outputs the intermediate model for each itera-
tion.

This distributed GIZA++ version finished training
the word alignment up to IBM Model 4 for both lan-
guage directions on the full bilingual corpus (260
million words, English) in 39 hours. On average
about 11 CPUs were running concurrently. In com-
parison the standard GIZA++ implementation fin-
ished the same training in 169 hours running on 2
CPUs, one for each language direction.

We used the Pharaoh/Moses package (Koehn et
al., 2007) to extract and score phrase pairs using the
grow-diag-final extraction method.

3.3 Translation Model

We trained two systems, one on the full data and one
without the out-of-domain corpora: UN parlament,
HK hansard and HK law parallel texts. These parla-
mentary sessions and law texts are very different in
genre and style from the MT test data, which con-
sists mainly of newspaper texts and in recent years
also of weblogs, broadcast news and broadcast con-
versation. The in-domain training data had 3.8 mil-
lion sentences and 67 million words (English). The
67 million word system reached a BLEU score of
29.65 on the unseeen MT06 testset. Even though the
full 260M system was trained on almost four times
as many running words, the baseline score for MT06
only increased by 0.6 to 30.22 BLEU (see Table 4).

System MT03 MT06
67M in-domain 32.42/60.26 29.65/61.22
260M full 32.20/60.59 30.22/60.81

Table 4: In-domain only or all training data, BLEU/TER

The 67M system could not translate 752 Chinese
words out of 38937, the number of unknown words
decreased to 564 for the 260M system. To increase
the unigram coverage of the phrase table, we added
the lexicon entries that were not in the phrase table
as one-word translations. This lowered the number
of unknown words further to 410, but did not effect
the translation score.

4 POS-based Reordering

As Chinese and English have very different word
order, reordering over a rather limited distance dur-
ing decoding is not sufficient. Also using a simple
distance based distortion probability leaves it essen-
tially to the language model to select among dif-
ferent reorderings. An alternative is to apply auto-
matically learned reordering rules to the test sen-
tences before decoding (Crego and Marino, 2006).
We create a word lattice, which encodes many re-
orderings and allows long distance reordering. This
keeps the translation process in the decoder mono-
tone and makes it significantly faster compared to
allowing long distance reordering at decoding time.

4.1 Learning Reordering Rules

We tag both language sides of the bilingual corpus
with POS information using the Stanford Parser3

and extract POS based reordering patterns from
word alignment information. We use the context in
which a reordering pattern is seen in the training data
as an additional feature. Context refers to the words
or tags to the left or to the right of the sequence for
which a reordering pattern is extracted.

Relative frequencies are computed for every rule
that has been seen more than n times in the training
corpus (we observed good results for n > 5).

For the Chinese system we used only 350k bilin-
gual sentence pairs to extract rules with length of
up to 15. We did not reorder the training corpus
to retrain the translation model on modified Chinese
word order.

4.2 Applying Reordering Rules

To avoid hard decisions, we build a lattice struc-
ture for each source sentence as input for our de-
coder, which contains reordering alternatives consis-
tent with the previously extracted rules.

Longer reordering patterns are applied first.
Thereby shorter patterns can match along new paths,
creating short distance reordering on top of long dis-
tance reordering. Every outgoing edge of a node is
scored with the relative frequency of the pattern used
on the following sub path (For details see (Rottmann
and Vogel, 2007)). These model scores give this re-

ordering approach an advantage over a simple jump
model with a sliding window.

260M, lattice 33.53/59.74 31.74/59.59

Table 5: Reordering lattice decoding in BLEU/TER

The system with reordering lattice input outper-
forms the system with a reordering window of 4
words by 1.5 BLEU (see Table 5).

5 Summary

The recent improvements to our Chinese-English
SMT system (see Fig. 1) can be mainly attributed to
a POS based word reordering method and the possi-
bility to work with larger statistical models.

We used the lattice translation functionality of our
decoder to translate reordering lattices. They are
built using reordering rules extracted from tagged
and aligned parallel data. There is further potential
for improvement in this approach, as we did not yet
reorder the training corpus and retrain the translation
model on modified Chinese word order.

We modified GIZA++ to run in parallel, which en-
abled us to include especially longer sentences into
translation model training. We also extended our de-
coder to use 5-gram language models and were able
to train an interpolated LM from all sources of the
English GigaWord Corpus.
