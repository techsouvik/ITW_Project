Abstract

We present a fast query-based multi-document
summarizer called FastSum based solely on
word-frequency features of clusters, docu-
ments and topics. Summary sentences are
ranked by a regression SVM. The summa-
rizer does not use any expensive NLP tech-
niques such as parsing, tagging of names or
even part of speech information. Still, the
achieved accuracy is comparable to the best
systems presented in recent academic com-
petitions (i.e., Document Understanding Con-
ference (DUC)). Because of a detailed fea-
ture analysis using Least Angle Regression
(LARS), FastSum can rely on a minimal set of
features leading to fast processing times: 1250
news documents in 60 seconds.

1 Introduction

In this paper, we propose a simple method for effec-
tively generating query-based multi-document sum-
maries without any complex processing steps. It
only involves sentence splitting, filtering candidate
sentences and computing the word frequencies in
the documents of a cluster, topic description and the
topic title. We use a machine learning technique
called regression SVM, as proposed by (Li et al.,
2007). For the feature selection we use a new model
selection technique called Least Angle Regression
(LARS) (Efron et al., 2004).

Even though machine learning approaches dom-
inated the field of summarization systems in recent
DUC competitions, not much effort has been spent
in finding simple but effective features. Exceptions

are the SumBasic system that achieves reasonable
results with only one feature (i.e., word frequency
in document clusters) (Nenkova and Vanderwende,
2005). Our approach goes beyond SumBasic by
proposing an even more powerful feature that proves
to be the best predictor in all three recent DUC cor-
pora. In order to prove that our feature is more pre-
dictive than other features we provide a rigorous fea-
ture analysis by employing LARS.

Scalability is normally not considered when dif-
ferent summarization systems are compared. Pro-
cessing time of more than several seconds per sum-
mary should be considered unacceptable, in partic-
ular, if you bear in mind that using such a system
should help a user to process lots of data faster. Our
focus is on selecting the minimal set of features that
are computationally less expensive than other fea-
tures (i.e., full parse). Since FastSum can rely on
a minimal set of features determined by LARS, it
can process 1250 news documents in 60 seconds.1

A comparison test with the MEAD system2 showed
that FastSum is more than 4 times faster.

2 System description

We use a machine learning approach to rank all sen-
tences in the topic cluster for summarizability. We
use some features from Microsoft’s PYTHY system
(Toutonova et al., 2007), but added two new fea-
tures, which turned out to be better predictors.

First, the pre-processing module carries out tok-
enization and sentence splitting. We also created
a sentence simplification component which is based

on a few regular expressions to remove unimportant
components of a sentence (e.g., As a matter of fact,).
This processing step does not involve any syntac-
tic parsing though. For further processing, we ig-
nore all sentences that do not have at least two exact
word matches or at least three fuzzy matches with
the topic description.3

Features are mainly based on word frequencies of
words in the clusters, documents and topics. A clus-
ter contains 25 documents and is associated with a
topic. The topic contains a topic title and the topic
descriptions. The topic title is list of key words or
phrases describing the topic. The topic description
contains the actual query or queries (e.g., Describe
steps taken and worldwide reaction prior to intro-
duction of the Euro on January 1, 1999.).

The features we used can be divided into two sets;
word-based and sentence-based. Word-based fea-
tures are computed based on the probability of words
for the different containers (i.e., cluster, document,
topic title and description). At runtime, the different
probabilities of all words in a candidate sentence are
added up and normalized by length. Sentence-based
features include the length and position of the sen-
tence in the document. The starred features 1 and
4 are introduced by us, whereas the others can be
found in earlier literature.4

*1 Topic title frequency (1): ratio of number of
words ti in the sentence s that also appear in
the topic title T to the total number of words

t1..|s| in the sentence s:
∑|s|

i=1
fT (ti)

|s| , where

fT =

{
1 : ti ∈ T
0 : otherwise

2 Topic description frequency (2): ratio of number
of words ti in the sentence s that also appear
in the topic description D to the total number

of words t1..|s| in the sentence s:
∑|s|

i=1
fD(ti)

|s| ,

where fD =

{
1 : ti ∈ D
0 : otherwise

3 Content word frequency(3): the average content
word probability pc(ti) of all content words

3Fuzzy matches are defined by the OVERLAP similarity
(Bollegala et al., 2007) of at least 0.1.

4The numbers are used in the feature analysis, as in figure 2.

t1..|s| in a sentence s. The content word proba-
bility is defined as pc(ti) = nN , where n is the
number of times the word occurred in the clus-
ter and N is the total number of words in the

cluster:
∑|s|

i=1
pc(ti)

|s|

*4 Document frequency (4): the average document
probability pd(ti) of all content words t1..|s| in
a sentence s. The document probability is de-
fined as pd(ti) =

d
D

, where d is the number of
documents the word ti occurred in for a given
cluster and D is the total number of documents

in the cluster:
∑|s|

i=1
pd(ti)

|s|

The remaining features are Headline frequency (5),
Sentence length (6), Sentence position (binary) (7),
and Sentence position (real) (8)

Eventually, each sentence is associated with a
score which is a linear combination of the above
mentioned feature values. We ignore all sentences
that do not have at least two exact word matches.5

In order to learn the feature weights, we trained a
SVM on the previous year’s data using the same fea-
ture set. We used a regression SVM. In regression,
the task is to estimate the functional dependence of
a dependent variable on a set of independent vari-
ables. In our case, the goal is to estimate the score
of a sentence based on the given feature set. In order
to get training data, we computed the word overlap
between the sentences from the document clusters
and the sentences in DUC model summaries. We
associated the word overlap score to the correspond-
ing sentence to generate the regression data. As a
last step, we use the pivoted QR decomposition to
handle redundancy. The basic idea is to avoid redun-
dancy by changing the relative importance of the rest
of the sentences based on the currently selected sen-
tence. The final summary is created from the ranked
sentence list after the redundancy removal step.

3 Results

We compared our system with the top performing
systems in the last two DUC competitions. With our
best performing features, we get ROUGE-2 (Lin,
2004) scores of 0.11 and 0.0925 on 2007 and 2006

5This threshold was derived experimentally with previous
data.

DUC data, respectively. These scores correspond
to rank 6th for DUC 2007 and the 2nd rank for
DUC 2006. Figure 1 shows a graphical compari-
son of our system with the top 6 systems in DUC
2007. According to an ANOVA test carried out by
the DUC organizers, these 6 systems are significant
better than the remaining 26 participating systems.

Note that our system is better than the PYTHY
system for 2006, if no sentence simplification was
carried out (DUC 2006: 0.089 (without simplifica-
tion); 0.096 (with simplification)). Sentence simpli-
fication is a computationally expensive process, be-
cause it requires a syntactic parse.

We evaluated the performance of the FastSum al-
gorithm using each of the features separately. Ta-
ble 1 shows the ROUGE score (recall) of the sum-
maries generated when we used each of the features
by themselves on 2006 and 2007 DUC data, trained
on the data from the respective previous year. Using
only the Document frequency feature by itself leads
to the second best system for DUC 2006 and to the
tenth best system for DUC 2007.

This first simple analysis of features indicates that
a more rigorous feature analysis would have bene-
fits for building simpler models. In addition, feature
selection could be guided by the complexity of the
features preferring those features that are computa-
tionally inexpensive.

We chose a so-called model selection algorithm
to find a minimal set of features. This problem can
be formulated as a shrinkage and selection method
for linear regression. The Least Angle Regres-
sion (LARS) (Efron et al., 2004) algorithm can be
used for computing the least absolute shrinkage and
selection operator (LASSO) (Tibshirani, 1996).At
each stage in LARS, the feature that is most corre-
lated with the response is added to the model. The
coefficient of the feature is set in the direction of the
sign of the feature’s correlation with the response.

We computed LARS on the DUC data sets from
the last three years. The graphical results for 2007
are shown in figure 2. In a LARS graph, features
are plotted on the x-axis and the corresponding co-
efficients are shown on y-axis. The value on the x-
axis is the ratio of norm of the coefficent vector to
the maximal norm with no constraint. The earlier a
feature appears on the x-axis, the better it is. Table
2 summarizes the best four features we determined
with LARS for the three available DUC data sets.

Table 2 shows that feature 4, document frequency,
is consistently the most important feature for all
three data sets. Content word frequency (3), on the
other hand, comes in as second best feature for 2006
and 2007, but not for 2005. For the 2005 data, the
Topic description frequency is the second best fea-
ture. This observation is reflected by our single fea-

ture analysis for DUC 2006, as shown in table 1.
Similarly, Vanderwende et al. (2006) report that they
gave the Topic description frequency a much higher
weight than the Content word frequency.

Consequently, we have shown that our new fea-
ture Document frequency is consistently the best
feature for all three past DUC corpora.

4 Conclusions

We proposed a fast query-based multi-document
summarizer called FastSum that produces state-of-
the-art summaries using a small set of predictors,
two of those are proposed by us: document fre-
quency and topic title frequency. A feature anal-
ysis using least angle regression (LARS) indicated
that the document frequency feature is the most use-
ful feature consistently for the last three DUC data
sets. Using document frequency alone can produce
competitive results for DUC 2006 and DUC 2007.
The two most useful feature that takes the topic de-
scription (i.e., the queries) into account is based on
the number of words in the topic description and the
topic title. Using a limited feature set of the 5 best
features generates summaries that are comparable to
the top systems of the DUC 2006 and 2007 main task
and can be generated in real-time, since no compu-
tationally expensive features (e.g., parsing) are used.

From these findings, we draw the following con-
clusions. Since a feature set mainly based on word
frequencies can produce state-of-the-art summaries,
we need to analyze further the current set-up for the

query-based multi-document summarization task. In
particular, we need to ask the question whether the
selection of relevant documents for the DUC top-
ics is in any way biased. For DUC, the document
clusters for a topic containing relevant documents
were always pre-selected by the assessors in prepa-
ration for DUC. Our analysis suggests that simple
word frequency computations of these clusters and
the documents alone can produce reasonable sum-
maries. However, the human selecting the relevant
documents may have already influenced the way
summaries can automatically be generated. Our sys-
tem and systems such as SumBasic or SumFocus
may just exploit the fact that relevant articles pre-
screened by humans contain a high density of good
content words for summarization.6
