Abstract
Many applications in NLP, such as question-
answering and summarization, either require
or would greatly benefit from the knowledge
of when an event occurred. Creating an ef-
fective algorithm for identifying the activ-
ity time of an event in news is difficult in
part because of the sparsity of explicit tem-
poral expressions. This paper describes a
domain-independent machine-learning based
approach to assign activity times to events
in news. We demonstrate that by applying
topic models to text, we are able to cluster
sentences that describe the same event, and
utilize the temporal information within these
event clusters to infer activity times for all sen-
tences. Experimental evidence suggests that
this is a promising approach, given evaluations
performed on three distinct news article sets
against the baseline of assigning the publica-
tion date. Our approach achieves 90%, 88.7%,
and 68.7% accuracy, respectively, outperform-
ing the baseline twice.

1 Introduction

Many practical applications in NLP either require
or would greatly benefit from the use of temporal
information. For instance, question-answering and
summarization systems demand accurate process-
ing of temporal information in order to be useful
for answering ’when’ questions and creating coher-
ent summaries by temporally ordering information.
Proper processing is especially relevant in news,
where multiple disparate events may be described
within one news article, and it is necessary to iden-
tify the separate timepoints of each event.

Event descriptions may be confined to one sen-
tence, which we establish as our text unit, or be
spread over many, thus forcing us to assign all sen-
tences an activity time. However, only 20%-30%
of sentences contain an explicit temporal expres-
sion, thus leaving the vast majority of sentences
without temporal information. A similar proportion
is reported in Mani et al. (2003), with only 25%
of clauses containing explicit temporal expressions.
The sparsity of these expressions poses a real chal-
lenge. Therefore, a method for efficiently and accu-
rately utilizing temporal expressions to infer activity
times for the remaining 70%-80% of sentences with
no temporal information is necessary.

This paper proposes a domain-independent
machine-learning based approach to assign activity
times to events in news without deferring to the pub-
lication date. Posing the problem in an informa-
tion retrieval framework, we model events by ap-
plying topic models to news, providing a way to
automatically distribute temporal information to all
sentences. The result is prototype system which
achieves promising results.

In the following section, we discuss related work
in temporal information processing. Next we moti-
vate the use of topic models for our task, and present
our methods for distributing temporal information.
We conclude by presenting and discussing our re-
sults.

ral expressions to assign activity times to the en-
tirety of an article. Their preliminary work on in-
ferring activity times suggested a baseline method
which spread time values of temporal expressions
to neighboring events based on proximity. Fila-
tova and Hovy (2001) also process explicit tempo-
ral expressions within a text and apply this informa-
tion throughout the whole article, assigning activity
times to all clauses.

More recent work has tried to temporally anchor
and order events in news by looking at clauses (Mani
et al., 2003). Due to the sparsity of temporal ex-
pressions, they computed a reference time for each
clause. The reference time is inferred using a num-
ber of linguistic features if no explicit reference is
present, but the algorithm defaults to assigning the
most recent time when all else fails.

A severe limitation of previous work is the depen-
dence on article structure. Mani and Wilson (2000)
attribute over half the errors of their baseline method
to propagation of an incorrect event time to neigh-
boring events. Filatova and Hovy (2001) infer time
values based on the most recently assigned date or
the date of the article. The previous approaches will
all perform unfavorably in the example presented in
Table 1, where a second historical event is referred
to between references to a current event. This kind
of example is quite common.

3 Modeling News

To address the aforementioned issues of sparsity
while relieving dependence on article structure, we
treat event discovery as a clustering problem. Clus-
tering methods have previously been used for event
identification (Hatzivassiloglou et al., 2000; Sid-
dharthan et al., 2004). After a topic model of news

text is created, sentences are clustered into topics -
where each topic represents a specific event. This
allows us to utilize all available temporal informa-
tion in each cluster to distribute to all the sentences
within that cluster, thus allowing for assigning of ac-
tivity times to sentences without explicit temporal
expressions. Our key assumption is that similar sen-
tences describe the same event.

Our approach is based on information retrieval
techniques, so we subsequently use the standard lan-
guage of text collections. We may refer to sentences,
or clusters of sentences created from a topic model
as ’documents’, and a collection of sentences, or col-
lection of clusters of sentences from one or more
news articles as a ’corpus’. We use Latent Dirich-
let Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003), a genera-
tive model for describing collections of text corpora,
which represents each document as a mixture over a
set of topics, where each topic has associated with it
a distribution over words. Topics are shared by all
documents in the corpus, but the topic distribution is
assumed to come from a Dirichlet distribution. LDA
allows documents to be composed of multiple topics
with varying proportions, thus capturing multiple la-
tent patterns.

Depending on the words present in each docu-
ment, we associate it with one of N topics, where N
is the number of latent topics in the model. We as-
sign each document to the topic which has the high-
est probability of having generated that document.
We expect document similarity in a cluster to be
fairly high, as evidenced by document modeling per-
formance in Blei et al. (2003). Since each cluster is
a collection of similar documents, with our assump-
tion that similar documents describe the same event,
we conclude that each cluster represents a specific
event. Thus, if at least one sentence in an event clus-
ter contains an explicit temporal expression, we can
distribute that activity time to other sentences in the
cluster using an inference algorithm we explain in
the next section. More than one event cluster may
represent the same event, as in Table 3, where both
topics describe a different perspective on the same
event: the administrative reaction to the incident at
Duke.

Creating a cluster of similar documents which
represent an event can be powerful. First, we are no
longer restricted by article structure. To refer back to

14



Table 1, our approach will assign the correct activ-
ity time for all event X sentences, even though they
are separated in the article and only one contains an
explicit temporal expression, by utilizing an event
cluster which contains the four sentences describing
event X to distribute the temporal information1.

Second, we are not restricted to using only one
article to assign activity times to sentences. In fact,
one of the major strengths of this approach is the
ability to take a collection of articles and treat them
all as one corpus, allowing the model to use all
explicit temporal expressions on event X present
throughout all of the articles to distribute activity
times. This is especially helpful in multidocument
summarization, where we have multiple articles on
the same event.

Additionally, using LDA as a method for event
identification may be advantageous over other clus-
tering methods. For one, Siddharthan et al. (2004)
reported that removing relative clauses and appos-
itives, which provide background or discourse re-
lated information, improves clustering. LDA allows
us to discover the presence of multiple events within
a sentence, and future work will focus on exploiting
this to improve clustering.

3.1 Corpus

We obtained 22 news articles, which can be divided
into three distinct sets: Duke Rape Case (DR), Ter-
rorist Bombings in Mumbai (MB), Israeli-Lebanese
conflict (IC) (Table 2). All articles come from En-
glish Newswire text, and each sentence was manu-
ally annotated with an activity time by people out-
side of the project. The Mumbai Bombing articles
all occur within a several day span, as do the Israeli-
Conflict articles. The Duke Rape case articles are
an exception, since they are comprised of multi-
ple events which happened over the course of sev-
eral months: Thus these articles contain many cases
such as ”The report said...on March 14...”, where
the report is actually in May, yet speaks of events
in March. For the purposes of this experiment we
took the union of the possible dates mentioned in a
sentence as acceptable activity times, thus both the
report statement date and the date mentioned in the

to all event Y sentences

report are correct activity times for the sentence. Fu-
ture work will investigate whether we can discrimi-
nate between these two dates.

Our approach relies on prior automatic linguistic
processing of the articles by the Proteus system (Gr-
ishman et al., 2005). The articles are annotated with
time expression tags, which assign values to both
absolute ”July 16, 2006” and relative ”now” tem-
poral expressions. Although present, our approach
does not currently use activity time ranges, such as
”past 2 weeks” or ”recent days”. The articles are
also given entity identification tags, which assigns a
unique intra-article id to entities of the types speci-
fied in the ACE 2005 evaluation. For example, both
”they” - an anaphoric reference - and ”police offi-
cers” are recognized as referring to the same real-
world entity.

3.2 Feature Extraction
From this point on unless otherwise noted, refer-
ence to news articles indicates one of the three sets
of news articles, not the complete set. We begin
by breaking news articles into their constituent sen-
tences, which are our ’documents’, the collection
of them being our ’corpus’, and indexing the doc-
uments.

We use the bag-of-words assumption to represent
each document as an unordered collection of words.
This allows the representation of each document as
a word vector. Additionally, we add any entity iden-
tification information and explicit temporal expres-
sions present in the document to the feature vector
representation of each document.

3.3 Intra-Article Event Representation
To represent events within one news article, we con-
struct a topic model for each article separately. The
Intra-Article (IAA) model constructed for an article
allows us to group sentences within that article to-
gether according to event. This allows the forma-
tion of new ’documents’, which consist not of single

The administrators did not know of the racial dimension until March 24, the report said.

The report did say that Brodhead was hampered by the administration’s lack of diversity.

He said administrators would be reviewed on their performance on the normal schedule
and he had no immediate plans to make personnel changes.

Administrators allowed the team to keep practicing; Athletics Director Joe Alleva called
the players ”wonderful young men.”

Yet even Duke faculty members, many of them from the ’60s and ’70s generations that
pushed college administrators to ease their controlling ways, now are urging the university
to require greater social as well as scholastic discipline from students.

Duke professors, in fact, are offering to help draft new behavior codes for the school.

With years of experience and academic success to their credit, faculty members ought to
be listened to.

For the moment, five study committees appointed by Brodhead seem to mean business,
which is encouraging.

Table 3: Two topics representing a different perspective
on the same event

sentences, but a cluster of sentences representing an
event. Accordingly, we combine the feature vector
representations of the single sentences in an event
cluster into one feature vector, forming an aggregate
of all their features. Although at this stage we have
everything we need to infer activity times, our ap-
proach allows incorporating information from mul-
tiple articles.

3.4 Inter-Article Event Representation

To represent events over multiple articles, we sug-
gest two methods for Inter-Article (IRA) topic mod-
eling. The first, IRA.1, is to combine the articles
and treat them as one large article. This allows pro-
cessing as described in IAA, with the exception that
event clusters may contain sentences from multiple
articles. The second, IRA.2, builds on IAA mod-
els of single articles and uses them to construct an
IRA model. The IRA.2 model is constructed over
a corpus of documents containing event clusters, al-
lowing a grouping of event clusters from multiple
articles. Event clusters may now be composed of
sentences describing the same event from multiple
articles, thus increasing our pool of explicit tempo-
ral expressions available for inference.

3.5 Activity Time Assignment

To accurately infer activity times of all sentences, it
is crucial to properly utilize the available temporal
expressions in the event clusters formed in the IRA
or IAA models. Our proposed inference algorithm
is a starting point for further work. We use the most
frequent activity time present in an event cluster as

the value to assign all the sentences in that event
cluster. In phase one of the algorithm we process
each event cluster separately. If the majority of sen-
tences with temporal expressions have the same ac-
tivity time, then this activity time is distributed to the
other sentences. If there is a tie between the num-
ber of occurrences of two activity times, both these
times are distributed as the activity time to the other
sentences. If there is no majority time and no tie
in the event cluster, then each of the sentences with
a temporal expression retains its activity time, but
no information is distributed to the other sentences.
Phase two of the inference algorithm reassembles
the sentences back into their original articles, with
most sentences now having activity times tags as-
signed from phase one. Sentences that remain un-
marked, indicating that they were in event clusters
with no majority and no tie, are assigned the ma-
jority activity time appearing in their reassembled
article.

4 Empirical Evaluation

In evaluating our approach, we wanted to compare
different methods of modeling events prior to per-
forming inference.

• Method (1) IAA then IRA.2 - Creating IAA
models with 20 topics for each news article,
and IRA.2 models for each of the three sets of
IAA models with 20, 50, and 100 topic.

• Method (2) IAA only - Creating an IAA model
with 20 topics for each article

• Method (3) IRA.1 only - Creating IRA.1 model
with 20 and 50 topics for each of the three sets
of articles.

4.1 Results
Table 4 presents results for the three sets of articles
on the six different experiments performed. Since
our approach assigns activity times to all sentences,
overall accuracy is measured as the total number of
correct activity time assignments made out of the
total number of sentences. The baseline accuracy
is computed by assigning each sentence the article
publication date, and because news generally de-
scribes current events, this achieves remarkably high
performance.

16



The overall accuracy measures performance of
the complete inference algorithm, while the rest of
the metrics measure the performance of phase one
only, where we process each event cluster separately.
Assessing the performance of phase one allows us to
indirectly evaluate the event clusters which we cre-
ate using LDA. M1 accuracy represents the number
of sentences that were assigned the correct activity
time in phase one out of the total number of activ-
ity time inferences made in phase one. Thus, this
does not take into account any assignments made by
phase two, and allows us to examine our assump-
tions about event representation expressed earlier. A
large denominator in M1 indicates that many sen-
tences were assigned in phase one, while a low one
indicates the presence of event clusters which were
unable to distribute temporal information.

M2 looks at how well the algorithm performs on
the difficult cases where the activity time is not the
same as the publication date. M3 looks at how well
the algorithm performs on the majority of sentences
which have no temporal expressions.

For the IC and DR sets, results show that Method
(1), where IAA is performed prior to IRA.2 achieves
the best performance, with accuracy of 88.7% and
90%, respectively, giving credence to the claim that
representing events within an article before combin-
ing multiple articles improves inference.

The MB set somewhat counteracts this claim, as
the best performance was achieved by Method (3),
where IRA.1 is performed. This may be due to the
fact that MB differs from DR and IC sets in that it
contains several regurgitated news articles. Regurgi-
tated news articles are comprised almost entirely of
statements made at a previous time in other news ar-
ticles. Method (3) combines similar sentences from
all the articles right away, placing sentences from re-
gurgitated articles in an event cluster with the orig-
inal sentences. This allows our approach to outper-
form the baseline system by 4.3%, with and accu-
racy of 68.7%.

5 Discussion

There are limitations to our approach which need
to be addressed. Foremost, evidence suggests that
event clusters are not perfect, as error analysis has
shown event clusters which represent two or more

events. Event clusters which contain sentences de-
scribing several events pose a real challenge, as
they are primarily responsible for inhibiting perfor-
mance. This limitation is not endemic to our ap-
proach for event discovery, as Xu et al. (2006) stated
that event extraction is still considered as one of the
most challenging tasks, because an event mention
can be expressed by several sentences and different
linguistic expressions.

One of the major strengths of our approach is the
ability to combine all temporal information on an
event from multiple articles. However, due the im-
perfect event clusters, combining temporal informa-
tion from different articles within an event cluster
has not yet yielded satisfactory results.

Although sentences from the same article in IRA
event clusters usually represent the same event, other
sentences from different articles may not. We mod-
ified the inference algorithm to reflect this, and only
consider sentences from the same news article when
distributing temporal information, even though sen-
tences from other articles may be present in the event
cluster. Therefore, further work to construct event
clusters which more closely represent events is ex-
pected to yield improvements in performance. Fu-
ture work will explore a richer feature set, including
such features as cross-document entity identification
information, linguistic features, and outside seman-
tic knowledge to increase robustness of the feature
vectors. Finally, the optimal model parameters are
currently selected by an oracle, however, we hope to
further evaluate our approach on a larger dataset in
order to determine how to automatically select the
optimal parameters.

6 Conclusion

This paper presented a novel approach for inferring
activity times for all sentences in a text. We demon-
strate we can produce reasonable event representa-
tions in an unsupervised fashion using LDA, pos-
ing event discovery as a clustering problem, and that
event clusters can further be used to distribute tem-
poral information to the sentences which lack ex-
plicit temporal expressions. Our approach achieves
90%, 88.7%, and 68.7% accuracy, outperforming
the baseline set forth in two cases. Although differ-
ences prevent a direct comparison, Mani and Wil-

son (2000) achieved an accuracy of 59.4% on 694
verb occurrences using their baseline method, Fi-
latova and Hovy (2001) achieved 82% accuracy on
time-stamping clauses for a single type of event on
172 clauses, and Mani et al. (2003) achieved 59%
accuracy in their algorithm for computing a refer-
ence time for 2069 clauses. Future work will im-
prove upon the majority criteria used in the inference
algorithm, on creating more accurate event represen-
tations, and on determining optimal model parame-
ters automatically.
