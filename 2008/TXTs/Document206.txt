Abstract

Developing a full coreference system able
to run all the way from raw text to seman-
tic interpretation is a considerable engineer-
ing effort, yet there is very limited avail-
ability of off-the shelf tools for researchers
whose interests are not in coreference, or for
researchers who want to concentrate on a
specific aspect of the problem. We present
BART, a highly modular toolkit for de-
veloping coreference applications. In the
Johns Hopkins workshop on using lexical
and encyclopedic knowledge for entity dis-
ambiguation, the toolkit was used to ex-
tend a reimplementation of the Soon et al.
(2001) proposal with a variety of additional
syntactic and knowledge-based features, and
experiment with alternative resolution pro-
cesses, preprocessing tools, and classifiers.

1 Introduction

Coreference resolution refers to the task of identify-
ing noun phrases that refer to the same extralinguis-
tic entity in a text. Using coreference information
has been shown to be beneficial in a number of other
tasks, including information extraction (McCarthy
and Lehnert, 1995), question answering (Morton,
2000) and summarization (Steinberger et al., 2007).
Developing a full coreference system, however, is
a considerable engineering effort, which is why a
large body of research concerned with feature en-
gineering or learning methods (e.g. Culotta et al.
2007; Denis and Baldridge 2007) uses a simpler but
non-realistic setting, using pre-identified mentions,
and the use of coreference information in summa-

rization or question answering techniques is not as
widespread as it could be. We believe that the avail-
ability of a modular toolkit for coreference will sig-
nificantly lower the entrance barrier for researchers
interested in coreference resolution, as well as pro-
vide a component that can be easily integrated into
other NLP applications.

A number of systems that perform coreference
resolution are publicly available, such as GUITAR
(Steinberger et al., 2007), which handles the full
coreference task, and JAVARAP (Qiu et al., 2004),
which only resolves pronouns. However, literature
on coreference resolution, if providing a baseline,
usually uses the algorithm and feature set of Soon
et al. (2001) for this purpose.

Using the built-in maximum entropy learner
with feature combination, BART reaches 65.8%
F-measure on MUC6 and 62.9% F-measure on
MUC7 using Soon et al.’s features, outperforming
JAVARAP on pronoun resolution, as well as the
Soon et al. reimplementation of Uryupina (2006).
Using a specialized tagger for ACE mentions and
an extended feature set including syntactic features
(e.g. using tree kernels to represent the syntactic
relation between anaphor and antecedent, cf. Yang
et al. 2006), as well as features based on knowledge
extracted from Wikipedia (cf. Ponzetto and Smith, in
preparation), BART reaches state-of-the-art results
on ACE-2. Table 1 compares our results, obtained
using this extended feature set, with results from
Ng (2007). Pronoun resolution using the extended
feature set gives 73.4% recall, coming near special-
ized pronoun resolution systems such as (Denis and
Baldridge, 2007).

2 System Architecture

The BART toolkit has been developed as a tool to
explore the integration of knowledge-rich features
into a coreference system at the Johns Hopkins Sum-
mer Workshop 2007. It is based on code and ideas
from the system of Ponzetto and Strube (2006), but
also includes some ideas from GUITAR (Steinberger
et al., 2007) and other coreference systems (Versley,
2006; Yang et al., 2006). 1

The goal of bringing together state-of-the-art ap-
proaches to different aspects of coreference res-
olution, including specialized preprocessing and
syntax-based features has led to a design that is very
modular. This design provides effective separation
of concerns across several several tasks/roles, in-
cluding engineering new features that exploit dif-
ferent sources of knowledge, designing improved or
specialized preprocessing methods, and improving
the way that coreference resolution is mapped to a
machine learning problem.

Preprocessing To store results of preprocessing
components, BART uses the standoff format of the
MMAX2 annotation tool (Müller and Strube, 2006)
with MiniDiscourse, a library that efficiently imple-
ments a subset of MMAX2’s functions. Using a
generic format for standoff annotation allows the use
of the coreference resolution as part of a larger sys-
tem, but also performing qualitative error analysis
using integrated MMAX2 functionality (annotation

diff, visual display).
Preprocessing consists in marking up noun

chunks and named entities, as well as additional in-
formation such as part-of-speech tags and merging
these information into markables that are the start-
ing point for the mentions used by the coreference
resolution proper.

Starting out with a chunking pipeline, which
uses a classical combination of tagger and chun-
ker, with the Stanford POS tagger (Toutanova et al.,
2003), the YamCha chunker (Kudoh and Mat-
sumoto, 2000) and the Stanford Named Entity Rec-
ognizer (Finkel et al., 2005), the desire to use richer
syntactic representations led to the development of
a parsing pipeline, which uses Charniak and John-
son’s reranking parser (Charniak and Johnson, 2005)
to assign POS tags and uses base NPs as chunk
equivalents, while also providing syntactic trees that
can be used by feature extractors. BART also sup-
ports using the Berkeley parser (Petrov et al., 2006),
yielding an easy-to-use Java-only solution.

To provide a better starting point for mention de-
tection on the ACE corpora, the Carafe pipeline
uses an ACE mention tagger provided by MITRE
(Wellner and Vilain, 2006). A specialized merger
then discards any base NP that was not detected to
be an ACE mention.

To perform coreference resolution proper, the
mention-building module uses the markables cre-
ated by the pipeline to create mention objects, which
provide an interface more appropriate for corefer-
ence resolution than the MiniDiscourse markables.
These objects are grouped into equivalence classes
by the resolution process and a coreference layer is
written into the document, which can be used for de-
tailed error analysis.

Feature Extraction BART’s default resolver goes
through all mentions and looks for possible an-
tecedents in previous mentions as described by Soon
et al. (2001). Each pair of anaphor and candi-
date is represented as a PairInstance object,
which is enriched with classification features by fea-
ture extractors, and then handed over to a machine
learning-based classifier that decides, given the fea-
tures, whether anaphor and candidate are corefer-
ent or not. Feature extractors are realized as sepa-
rate classes, allowing for their independent develop-

ment. The set of feature extractors that the system
uses is set in an XML description file, which allows
for straightforward prototyping and experimentation
with different feature sets.

Learning BART provides a generic abstraction
layer that maps application-internal representations
to a suitable format for several machine learning
toolkits: One module exposes the functionality of
the the WEKA machine learning toolkit (Witten
and Frank, 2005), while others interface to special-
ized state-of-the art learners. SVMLight (Joachims,
1999), in the SVMLight/TK (Moschitti, 2006) vari-
ant, allows to use tree-valued features. SVM Classi-
fication uses a Java Native Interface-based wrapper
replacing SVMLight/TK’s svm classify pro-
gram to improve the classification speed. Also in-
cluded is a Maximum entropy classifier that is
based upon Robert Dodier’s translation of Liu and
Nocedal’s (1989) L-BFGS optimization code, with
a function for programmatic feature combination.2

Training/Testing The training and testing phases
slightly differ from each other. In the training phase,
the pairs that are to be used as training examples
have to be selected in a process of sample selection,
whereas in the testing phase, it has to be decided
which pairs are to be given to the decision function
and how to group mentions into equivalence rela-
tions given the classifier decisions.

This functionality is factored out into the en-

coder/decoder component, which is separate from
feature extraction and machine learning itself. It
is possible to completely change the basic behav-
ior of the coreference system by providing new
encoders/decoders, and still rely on the surround-
ing infrastructure for feature extraction and machine
learning components.

3 Using BART

Although BART is primarily meant as a platform for
experimentation, it can be used simply as a corefer-
ence resolver, with a performance close to state of
the art. It is possible to import raw text, perform
preprocessing and coreference resolution, and either
work on the MMAX2-format files, or export the re-
sults to arbitrary inline XML formats using XSL
stylesheets.

Adapting BART to a new coreferentially anno-
tated corpus (which may have different rules for
mention extraction – witness the differences be-
tween the annotation guidelines of MUC and ACE
corpora) usually involves fine-tuning of mention cre-
ation (using pipeline and MentionFactory settings),
as well as the selection and fine-tuning of classi-
fier and features. While it is possible to make rad-
ical changes in the preprocessing by re-engineering
complete pipeline components, it is usually possi-
ble to achieve the bulk of the task by simply mix-
ing and matching existing components for prepro-
cessing and feature extraction, which is possible by
modifying only configuration settings and an XML-

Several research groups focusing on coreference
resolution, including two not involved in the ini-
tial creation of BART, are using it as a platform
for research including the use of new information
sources (which can be easily incorporated into the
coreference resolution process as features), different
resolution algorithms that aim at enhancing global
coherence of coreference chains, and also adapting
BART to different corpora. Through the availability
of BART as open source, as well as its modularity
and adaptability, we hope to create a larger com-
munity that allows both to push the state of the art
further and to make these improvements available to
users of coreference resolution.
