Abstract

Yawat
1 is a tool for the visualization and ma-

nipulation of word- and phrase-level alignments

of parallel text. Unlike most other tools for

manual word alignment, it relies on dynamic

markup to visualize alignment relations, that

is, markup is shown and hidden depending on

the current mouse position. This reduces the

visual complexity of the visualization and al-

lows the annotator to focus on one item at a

time. For a bird’s-eye view of alignment pat-

terns within a sentence, the tool is also able to

display alignments as alignment matrices. In

addition, it allows for manual labeling of align-

ment relations with customizable tag sets. Dif-

ferent text colors are used to indicate which

words in a given sentence pair have already

been aligned, and which ones still need to be

aligned. Tag sets and color schemes can easily

be adapted to the needs of specific annotation

projects through configuration files. The tool

is implemented in JavaScript and designed to

run as a web application.

1 Introduction

Sub-sentential alignments of parallel text play an
important role in statistical machine translation
(SMT). Aligning parallel data on the word- or
phrase-level is typically one of the first steps in build-
ing SMT systems, as those alignments constitute the
basis for the construction of probabilistic translation
dictionaries. Consequently, considerable effort has
gone into devising and improving automatic word
alignment algorithms, and into evaluating their per-
formance (e.g., Och and Ney, 2003; Taskar et al.,
2005; Moore et al., 2006; Fraser and Marcu, 2006,
among many others). For the sake of simplicity, we
will in the following use the term “word alignment”

1Yawat was first presented at the 2007 Linguistic Annota-
tion Workshop (Germann, 2007).

to refer to any form of alignment that identifies words
or groups of words as translations of each other.

Any explicit evaluation of word alignment qual-
ity requires human intervention at some point, be
it in the direct evaluation of candidate word align-
ments produced by a word alignment system, or in
the creation of a gold standard against which can-
didate word alignments can be compared automati-
cally. This human intervention works best with an
interactive, visual interface.

2 Word alignment visualization

Over the years, numerous tools for the visualization
and creation of word alignments have been devel-
oped (e.g., Melamed, 1998; Smith and Jahr, 2000;
Ahrenberg et al., 2002; Rassier and Pedersen, 2003;
Daumé; Tiedemann; Hwa and Madnani, 2004; Lam-
bert, 2004; Tiedemann, 2006). Most of them employ
one of two visualization techniques. The first is to
draw lines between associated words, as shown in
Fig. 1. The second is to use an alignment matrix
(Fig. 2), where the rows of the matrix correspond to
the words of the sentence in one language and the
columns to the words of that sentence’s translation
into the other language. Marks in the matrix’s cells
indicate whether the words represented by the row
and column of the cell are linked or not. A third
technique, employed in addition to drawing lines by
Melamed (1998) and as the sole mechanism by Tiede-
mann (2006), is to use colors to indicate which words
correspond to each other on the two sides of the par-
allel corpus.

The three techniques just mentioned work reason-
ably well for very short sentences, but reach their
limits quickly as sentence length increases. Align-
ment visualization by coloring schemes requires as
many different colors as there are words in the
(shorter) sentence. Alignment visualization by draw-
ing lines and alignment matrices both require that
each of the two sentences in each sentence pair is

presented in a single line or column. Pairs of long
sentences therefore often cannot be shown entirely on
the screen. Aligning pairs of long sentences then re-
quires scrolling back and forth, especially when there
are considerable differences in word order between
the two languages. Moreover, as sentence length in-
creases, visualization by drawing lines quickly be-

comes cluttered, and alignment matrices become
hard to track. We believe that it is not only because
of the intrinsic difficulties of explaining translations
by word alignment but also because of such interface
issues that aligning words manually has the reputa-
tion of being a very tedious task.

3 Yawat

Yawat (Yet Another Word Alignment Tool) was de-
veloped to remedy this situation by providing an ef-
ficient interface for creating and editing word align-
ments manually. It is implemented as web applica-
tion with a thin CGI script on the server side and
a browser-based2 client written in JavaScript. This
setup facilitates collaborative efforts with multiple
annotators working remotely without the overhead
of needing to organize the transfer of alignment data
separately. The server-side data structure was de-
liberately kept small and simple, so that the tool or
some of its components can be used as a visualization
front-end for existing word alignments.

Yawat’s most prominent distinguishing feature is

2Unfortunately, differences in the underlying DOM imple-
mentations make it laborious to implement truly browser-
independent web applications in JavaScript. Yawat was de-
veloped for FireFox and currently won’t work in Internet Ex-
plorer.

Figure 3: Alignment visualization with Yawat. As the mouse is moved over a word, the word and all words linked

with it are highlighted. The highlighting is removed when the mouse leaves the word in question. This allows the

annotator to focus on one item at a time, without any distracting visual clutter from other word alignments.

side as in this screenshot or stacked as in Fig. 3.

the use of dynamic instead of static visualization.
Rather than showing alignment links permanently
by drawing lines or showing marks in an alignment
matrix, associated words are shown only for one word
at a time, as determined by the location of the mouse
pointer. When the mouse is moved over a word in the
text, the word and all the words associated with it
are highlighted; when the mouse is moved away, the
highlighting is removed. Figure 3 gives a snapshot of
the tool in action.

Designed primarily as a tool for creating word
alignments, one design objective was to minimize
mouse travel required to align words. The inter-
face therefore has no ‘link words’ button but uses
mouse clicks on words directly to establish alignment
links. A left-click on a word puts the tool into edit
mode and opens an ‘alignment group’ (i.e., a set of
words that supposedly constitute the expression of
a concept in the two languages). Additional left-
clicks on other words add them to or remove them
from the current alignment group. A final right-click
closes the group and puts the tool back into view
mode. The typical case of aligning just two indi-
vidual words thus takes only a single click on each
of the two words: a left-click on the first word and a
right-click on the second. As words are aligned, their
color changes to indicate that they have been dealt
with, so that the annotator can easily keep track of
which words have been aligned, and which ones still
need to be aligned. Notice the difference in color
(or shading in a gray-scale printout) in the sentences
in Fig. 3, whose first halves have been aligned while
their latter halves are still unaligned.

In view mode, alignment groups can be labeled
with a customizable set of tags via a context menu

Figure 5: Yawat can also show alignments as alignment

matrices. The tooltip-like floating bar above the mouse

pointer provides column labels.

triggered by a right-click on a word (Fig. 4). For ex-
ample, one might want to classify translational corre-
spondences as ‘literal’, ‘non-literal / free’, or ‘coref-
erential without intensional equivalence’. Different
colors are used to indicate different types of align-
ment; color schemes and tag sets can be configured
on the server side.

3.1 Alignment matrix display

One of the drawbacks of the dynamic visualization
scheme employed in Yawat is that it provides no
bird’s-eye view of the overall alignment structure, as

22



it is provided by alignment matrices. We therefore
decided to add alignment matrices as an additional
visualization option. Alignment matrices are created
on demand and can be switched on and off for each
sentence pair. Word alignments can be edited in the
alignment matrix view by clicking into the respective
matrix cells to link or unlink words. Alignments ma-
trices and the normal side-by-side or top-and-bottom
display of the sentence pair in question are inter-
linked, so that an changes in the alignment matrix
are immediately visible in the ‘normal’ display and
vice versa (see Fig. 5).
