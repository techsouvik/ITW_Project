1 Introduction

The amount of unlabeled linguistic data available
to us is much larger and growing much faster than
the amount of labeled data. Semi-supervised learn-
ing algorithms combine unlabeled data with a small
labeled training set to train better models. This
tutorial emphasizes practical applications of semi-
supervised learning; we treat semi-supervised learn-
ing methods as tools for building effective models
from limited training data. An attendee will leave
our tutorial with

1. A basic knowledge of the most common classes
of semi-supervised learning algorithms and where
they have been used in NLP before.

2. The ability to decide which class will be useful
in her research.

3. Suggestions against potential pitfalls in semi-
supervised learning.

2 Content Overview

Self-training methods Self-training methods use
the labeled data to train an initial model and then
use that model to label the unlabeled data and re-
train a new model. We will examine in detail the co-
training method of Blum and Mitchell [2], includ-
ing the assumptions it makes, and two applications
of co-training to NLP data. Another popular self-
training method treats the labels of the unlabeled
data as hidden and estimates a single model from
labeled and unlabeled data. We explore new meth-
ods in this framework that make use of declarative
linguistic side information to constrain the solutions
found using unlabeled data [3].

Graph regularization methods Graph regulariza-
tion methods build models based on a graph on in-
stances, where edges in the graph indicate similarity.
The regularization constraint is one of smoothness
along this graph. We wish to find models that per-
form well on the training data, but we also regularize
so that unlabeled nodes which are similar according
to the graph have similar labels. For this section, we
focus in detail on the Gaussian fields method of Zhu
et al. [4].
Structural learning Structural learning [1] uses un-
labeled data to find a new, reduced-complexity hy-
pothesis space by exploiting regularities in feature
space via unlabeled data. If this new hypothesis
space still contains good hypotheses for our super-
vised learning problem, we may achieve high accu-
racy with much less training data. The regularities
we use come in the form of lexical features that func-
tion similarly for prediction. This section will fo-
cus on the assumptions behind structural learning, as
well as applications to tagging and sentiment analy-
sis.
