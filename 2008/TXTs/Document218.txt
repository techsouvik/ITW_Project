1 Introduction 

This tutorial is about the evolution of speech technology 
from research to a mature industry. Today, spoken lan-
guage communication with computers is becoming part 
of everyday life. Thousands of interactive applications 
using spoken language technology— known also as 
“conversational machines”—are only phone calls away, 
allowing millions of users each day to access informa-
tion, perform transactions, and get help.  Speech recog-
nition, language understanding, text-to-speech 
synthesis, machine learning, and dialog management 
enabled this revolution after more than 50 years of re-
search. The industry of speech continues to mature with 
its evolving standards, platforms, architectures, and 
business models within different sectors of the market. 
 

2 Content Overview 

In this tutorial I will briefly trace the history of speech 
technology, with a special focus on speech recognition 
and spoken language understanding, from the early at-
tempts to today’s commercial deployments. I will sum-
marily describe the most successful ideas and 
algorithms that brought to today’s technology. I will 
discuss the struggle for ever increasing performance, the 
importance of data for training and evaluation, and the 
role played by government funded projects in creating 
effective evaluation benchmarks. I will then describe the 
birth of the speech industry in the mid 1990s, with the 
role played by the Voice User Interface and dialog en-
gineering disciplines in bringing speech recognition 
from a laboratory “accuracy challenge” to an enabler of 
usable interfaces. I will describe the rising of standards 
(such as VoiceXML, SRGS, SSML, etc.) and their im-
portance in the growth of the market. I will proceed 
with an overview of the current architectures and proc-
esses utilized for creating commercial spoken dialog 
systems, and will provide several case studies of the use 
of speech technology. I will conclude with a discussion 
on the current open problems and challenges. 
 

The tutorial duration will be of about 3 hours with a 
short break. Several audio and video samples will be 
shown during the tutorial. The tutorial is directed to a 
general HLT audience with no prior knowledge of 
speech technology.
