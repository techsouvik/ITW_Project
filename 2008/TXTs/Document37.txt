Abstract

Online reviews are often accompanied with

numerical ratings provided by users for a set

of service or product aspects. We propose

a statistical model which is able to discover

corresponding topics in text and extract tex-

tual evidence from reviews supporting each of

these aspect ratings – a fundamental problem

in aspect-based sentiment summarization (Hu

and Liu, 2004a). Our model achieves high ac-

curacy, without any explicitly labeled data ex-

cept the user provided opinion ratings. The

proposed approach is general and can be used

for segmentation in other applications where

sequential data is accompanied with corre-

lated signals.

1 Introduction

User generated content represents a unique source of

information in which user interface tools have facil-

itated the creation of an abundance of labeled con-

tent, e.g., topics in blogs, numerical product and ser-

vice ratings in user reviews, and helpfulness rank-

ings in online discussion forums. Many previous

studies on user generated content have attempted to

predict these labels automatically from the associ-

ated text. However, these labels are often present

in the data already, which opens another interesting

line of research: designing models leveraging these

labelings to improve a wide variety of applications.

In this study, we look at the problem of aspect-

based sentiment summarization (Hu and Liu, 2004a;

Popescu and Etzioni, 2005; Gamon et al., 2005;

Nikos’ Fine Dining

Food 4/5 “Best fish in the city”, “Excellent appetizers”

Decor 3/5 “Cozy with an old world feel”, “Too dark”

Service 1/5 “Our waitress was rude”, “Awful service”

Value 5/5 “Good Greek food for the $”, “Great price!”

Figure 1: An example aspect-based summary.

Carenini et al., 2006; Zhuang et al., 2006).1 An

aspect-based summarization system takes as input

a set of user reviews for a specific product or ser-

vice and produces a set of relevant aspects, the ag-

gregated sentiment for each aspect, and supporting

textual evidence. For example, figure 1 summarizes

a restaurant using aspects food, decor, service, and

value plus a numeric rating out of 5.

Standard aspect-based summarization consists of

two problems. The first is aspect identification and

mention extraction. Here the goal is to find the set

of relevant aspects for a rated entity and extract all

textual mentions that are associated with each. As-

pects can be fine-grained, e.g., fish, lamb, calamari,

or coarse-grained, e.g., food, decor, service. Sim-

ilarly, extracted text can range from a single word

to phrases and sentences. The second problem is

sentiment classification. Once all the relevant as-

pects and associated pieces of texts are extracted,

the system should aggregate sentiment over each as-

pect to provide the user with an average numeric or

symbolic rating. Sentiment classification is a well

studied problem (Wiebe, 2000; Pang et al., 2002;

Turney, 2002) and in many domains users explicitly

We use the term aspect to denote properties of an object

that can be rated by a user as in Snyder and Barzilay (2007).

Other studies use the term feature (Hu and Liu, 2004b).

provide ratings for each aspect making automated

means unnecessary.2 Aspect identification has also

been thoroughly studied (Hu and Liu, 2004b; Ga-

mon et al., 2005; Titov and McDonald, 2008), but

again, ontologies and users often provide this infor-

mation negating the need for automation.

Though it may be reasonable to expect a user to

provide a rating for each aspect, it is unlikely that

a user will annotate every sentence and phrase in a

review as being relevant to some aspect. Thus, it

can be argued that the most pressing challenge in

an aspect-based summarization system is to extract

all relevant mentions for each aspect, as illustrated

in figure 2. When labeled data exists, this prob-

lem can be solved effectively using a wide variety

of methods available for text classification and in-

formation extraction (Manning and Schutze, 1999).

However, labeled data is often hard to come by, es-

pecially when one considers all possible domains of

products and services. Instead, we propose an un-

supervised model that leverages aspect ratings that

frequently accompany an online review.

In order to construct such model, we make two

assumptions. First, ratable aspects normally repre-

sent coherent topics which can be potentially dis-

covered from co-occurrence information in the text.

Second, we hypothesize that the most predictive fea-

tures of an aspect rating are features derived from

the text segments discussing the corresponding as-

pect. Motivated by these observations, we construct

a joint statistical model of text and sentiment ratings.

The model is at heart a topic model in that it as-

signs words to a set of induced topics, each of which

may represent one particular aspect. The model is

extended through a set of maximum entropy classi-

fiers, one per each rated aspect, that are used to pre-

2E.g., http://zagat.com and http://tripadvisor.com.

dict the sentiment rating towards each of the aspects.

However, only the words assigned to an aspects cor-

responding topic are used in predicting the rating

for that aspect. As a result, the model enforces that

words assigned to an aspects’ topic are predictive of

the associated rating. Our approach is more general

than the particular statistical model we consider in

this paper. For example, other topic models can be

used as a part of our model and the proposed class of

models can be employed in other tasks beyond senti-

ment summarization, e.g., segmentation of blogs on

the basis of topic labels provided by users, or topic

discovery on the basis of tags given by users on so-

cial bookmarking sites.3

The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Sec-

tion 2 begins with a discussion of the joint text-

sentiment model approach. In Section 3 we provide

both a qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the

proposed method. We conclude in Section 4 with an

examination of related work.

2 The Model

In this section we describe a new statistical model

called the Multi-Aspect Sentiment model (MAS),

which consists of two parts. The first part is based on

Multi-Grain Latent Dirichlet Allocation (Titov and

McDonald, 2008), which has been previously shown

to build topics that are representative of ratable as-

pects. The second part is a set of sentiment pre-

dictors per aspect that are designed to force specific

topics in the model to be directly correlated with a

particular aspect.

2.1 Multi-Grain LDA

The Multi-Grain Latent Dirichlet Allocation model

(MG-LDA) is an extension of Latent Dirichlet Allo-

cation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003). As was demon-

3See e.g. del.ico.us (http://del.ico.us).

309



strated in Titov and McDonald (2008), the topics

produced by LDA do not correspond to ratable as-

pects of entities. In particular, these models tend to

build topics that globally classify terms into product

instances (e.g., Creative Labs Mp3 players versus

iPods, or New York versus Paris Hotels). To com-

bat this, MG-LDA models two distinct types of top-

ics: global topics and local topics. As in LDA, the

distribution of global topics is fixed for a document

(a user review). However, the distribution of local

topics is allowed to vary across the document.

A word in the document is sampled either from

the mixture of global topics or from the mixture of

local topics specific to the local context of the word.

It was demonstrated in Titov and McDonald (2008)

that ratable aspects will be captured by local topics

and global topics will capture properties of reviewed

items. For example, consider an extract from a re-

view of a London hotel: “. . . public transport in Lon-

don is straightforward, the tube station is about an 8

minute walk . . . or you can get a bus for £1.50”. It

can be viewed as a mixture of topic London shared

by the entire review (words: “London”, “tube”, “£”),

and the ratable aspect location, specific for the local

context of the sentence (words: “transport”, “walk”,

“bus”). Local topics are reused between very differ-

ent types of items, whereas global topics correspond

only to particular types of items.

In MG-LDA a document is represented as a set

of sliding windows, each covering T adjacent sen-

tences within a document.4 Each window v in docu-

ment d has an associated distribution over local top-

ics θloc
d,v

and a distribution defining preference for lo-

cal topics versus global topics πd,v. A word can be

sampled using any window covering its sentence s,

where the window is chosen according to a categor-

ical distribution ψd,s. Importantly, the fact that win-

dows overlap permits the model to exploit a larger

co-occurrence domain. These simple techniques are

capable of modeling local topics without more ex-

pensive modeling of topic transitions used in (Grif-

fiths et al., 2004; Wang and McCallum, 2005; Wal-

lach, 2006; Gruber et al., 2007). Introduction of a

symmetrical Dirichlet prior Dir(γ) for the distribu-
tion ψd,s can control the smoothness of transitions.

4Our particular implementation is over sentences, but sliding

windows in theory can be over any sized fragment of text.

LDA to obtain MAS.

The formal definition of the model with Kgl

global and K loc local topics is as follows: First,

draw Kgl word distributions for global topics ϕ
gl
z

from a Dirichlet prior Dir(βgl) and K loc word dis-
tributions for local topics ϕloc

z′
- from Dir(βloc).

Then, for each document d:

• Choose a distribution of global topics θ
gl

d
∼ Dir(αgl).

• For each sentence s choose a distribution over sliding

windows ψd,s(v) ∼ Dir(γ).

• For each sliding window v

– choose θlocd,v ∼ Dir(α
loc),

– choose πd,v ∼ Beta(α
mix).

• For each word i in sentence s of document d

– choose window vd,i ∼ ψd,s,

– choose rd,i ∼ πd,vd,i ,

– if rd,i = gl choose global topic zd,i ∼ θ
gl

d
,

– if rd,i= loc choose local topic zd,i∼θ

d,vd,i

,

– choose word wd,i from the word distribution ϕ
rd,i
zd,i .

Beta(αmix) is a prior Beta distribution for choos-
ing between local and global topics. In Figure 3a the

corresponding graphical model is presented.

2.2 Multi-Aspect Sentiment Model

MG-LDA constructs a set of topics that ideally cor-

respond to ratable aspects of an entity (often in a

many-to-one relationship of topics to aspects). A

major shortcoming of this model – and all other un-

supervised models – is that this correspondence is

not explicit, i.e., how does one say that topic X is re-

ally about aspect Y? However, we can observe that

numeric aspect ratings are often included in our data

by users who left the reviews. We then make the

assumption that the text of the review discussing an

aspect is predictive of its rating. Thus, if we model

the prediction of aspect ratings jointly with the con-

struction of explicitly associated topics, then such a

310



model should benefit from both higher quality topics

and a direct assignment from topics to aspects. This

is the basic idea behind the Multi-Aspect Sentiment

model (MAS).

In its simplest form, MAS introduces a classifier

for each aspect, which is used to predict its rating.

Each classifier is explicitly associated to a single

topic in the model and only words assigned to that

topic can participate in the prediction of the senti-

ment rating for the aspect. However, it has been ob-

served that ratings for different aspects can be cor-

related (Snyder and Barzilay, 2007), e.g., very neg-

ative opinion about room cleanliness is likely to re-

sult not only in a low rating for the aspect rooms,

but also is very predictive of low ratings for the as-

pects service and dining. This complicates discovery

of the corresponding topics, as in many reviews the

most predictive features for an aspect rating might

correspond to another aspect. Another problem with

this overly simplistic model is the presence of opin-

ions about an item in general without referring to

any particular aspect. For example, “this product is

the worst I have ever purchased” is a good predic-

tor of low ratings for every aspect. In such cases,

non-aspect ‘background’ words will appear to be the

most predictive. Therefore, the use of the aspect sen-

timent classifiers based only on the words assigned

to the corresponding topics is problematic. Such a

model will not be able to discover coherent topics

associated with each aspect, because in many cases

the most predictive fragments for each aspect rating

will not be the ones where this aspect is discussed.

Our proposal is to estimate the distribution of pos-

sible values of an aspect rating on the basis of the

overall sentiment rating and to use the words as-

signed to the corresponding topic to compute cor-

rections for this aspect. An aspect rating is typically

correlated to the overall sentiment rating5 and the

fragments discussing this particular aspect will help

to correct the overall sentiment in the appropriate di-

rection. For example, if a review of a hotel is gen-

erally positive, but it includes a sentence “the neigh-

borhood is somewhat seedy” then this sentence is

predictive of rating for an aspect location being be-

low other ratings. This rectifies the aforementioned

5In the dataset used in our experiments all three aspect rat-

ings are equivalent for 5,250 reviews out of 10,000.

problems. First, aspect sentiment ratings can often

be regarded as conditionally independent given the

overall rating, therefore the model will not be forced

to include in an aspect topic any words from other

aspect topics. Secondly, the fragments discussing

overall opinion will influence the aspect rating only

through the overall sentiment rating. The overall

sentiment is almost always present in the real data

along with the aspect ratings, but it can be coarsely

discretized and we preferred to use a latent overall

sentiment.

The MAS model is presented in Figure 3b. Note

that for simplicity we decided to omit in the figure

the components of the MG-LDA model other than

variables r, z and w, though they are present in the

statistical model. MAS also allows for extra unasso-

ciated local topics in order to capture aspects not ex-

plicitly rated by the user. As in MG-LDA, MAS has

global topics which are expected to capture topics

corresponding to particular types of items, such Lon-

don hotels or seaside resorts for the hotel domain. In

figure 3b we shaded the aspect ratings ya, assuming

that every aspect rating is present in the data (though

in practice they might be available only for some re-

views). In this model the distribution of the overall

sentiment rating yov is based on all the n-gram fea-

tures of a review text. Then the distribution of ya, for

every rated aspect a, can be computed from the dis-

tribution of yov and from any n-gram feature where

at least one word in the n-gram is assigned to the

associated aspect topic (r = loc, z = a).
Instead of having a latent variable yov,

6 we use a

similar model which does not have an explicit no-

tion of yov. The distribution of a sentiment rating ya
for each rated aspect a is computed from two scores.

The first score is computed on the basis of all the n-

grams, but using a common set of weights indepen-

dent of the aspect a. Another score is computed only

using n-grams associated with the related topic, but

an aspect-specific set of weights is used in this com-

putation. More formally, we consider the log-linear

distribution:

P (ya = y|w, r, z)∝exp(b

ment, assignments of context (global or local) and

topics for all the words in the document, respec-

tively. bay is the bias term which regulates the prior

are common weights and

aspect-specific weights for n-gram feature f . pa
f,r,z

is equal to a fraction of words in n-gram feature f

assigned to the aspect topic (r = loc, z = a).

2.3 Inference in MAS

Exact inference in the MAS model is intractable.

Following Titov and McDonald (2008) we use a col-

lapsed Gibbs sampling algorithm that was derived

for the MG-LDA model based on the Gibbs sam-

pling method proposed for LDA in (Griffiths and

Steyvers, 2004). Gibbs sampling is an example of a

Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm (Geman and

Geman, 1984). It is used to produce a sample from

a joint distribution when only conditional distribu-

tions of each variable can be efficiently computed.

In Gibbs sampling, variables are sequentially sam-

pled from their distributions conditioned on all other

variables in the model. Such a chain of model states

converges to a sample from the joint distribution. A

naive application of this technique to LDA would

imply that both assignments of topics to words z

and distributions θ and ϕ should be sampled. How-

ever, (Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004) demonstrated

that an efficient collapsed Gibbs sampler can be con-

structed, where only assignments z need to be sam-

pled, whereas the dependency on distributions θ and

ϕ can be integrated out analytically.

In the case of MAS we also use maximum a-

posteriori estimates of the sentiment predictor pa-

rameters bay, Jy,f and J
a
y,f

. The MAP estimates for

parameters bay , Jy,f and J
a
y,f

are obtained by us-

ing stochastic gradient ascent. The direction of the

gradient is computed simultaneously with running a

chain by generating several assignments at each step

and averaging over the corresponding gradient esti-

mates. For details on computing gradients for log-

linear graphical models with Gibbs sampling we re-

fer the reader to (Neal, 1992).

Space constraints do not allow us to present either

the derivation or a detailed description of the sam-

pling algorithm. However, note that the conditional

distribution used in sampling decomposes into two

parts:

P (vd,i = v, rd,i = r, zd,i = z|v’, r’, z’,w, y) ∝

ηd,iv,r,z × ρ
d,i
r,z, (2)

where v’, r’ and z’ are vectors of assignments of

sliding windows, context (global or local) and top-

ics for all the words in the collection except for the

considered word at position i in document d; y is the

vector of sentiment ratings. The first factor η
d,i
v,r,z is

responsible for modeling co-occurrences on the win-

dow and document level and coherence of the topics.

This factor is proportional to the conditional distri-

bution used in the Gibbs sampler of the MG-LDA

model (Titov and McDonald, 2008). The last fac-

tor quantifies the influence of the assignment of the

word (d, i) on the probability of the sentiment rat-
ings. It appears only if ratings are known (observ-

able) and equals:

ρd,ir,z =
∏

a

P (yda|w, r’, rd,i = r, z’, zd,i = z)

P (yda|w, r’, z’, rd,i = gl)
,

where the probability distribution is computed as de-

fined in expression (1), yda is the rating for the ath

aspect of review d.

3 Experiments

In this section we present qualitative and quantita-

tive experiments. For the qualitative analysis we

show that topics inferred by the MAS model cor-

respond directly to the associated aspects. For the

quantitative analysis we show that the MAS model

induces a distribution over the rated aspects which

can be used to accurately predict whether a text frag-

ment is relevant to an aspect or not.

3.1 Qualitative Evaluation

To perform qualitative experiments we used a set

of reviews of hotels taken from TripAdvisor.com7

that contained 10,000 reviews (109,024 sentences,

2,145,313 words in total). Every review was

rated with at least three aspects: service, location

and rooms. Each rating is an integer from 1 to 5.

The dataset was tokenized and sentence split auto-

matically.

.

We ran the sampling chain for 700 iterations to

produce a sample. Distributions of words in each

topic were estimated as the proportion of words as-

signed to each topic, taking into account topic model

priors βgl and βloc. The sliding windows were cho-

sen to cover 3 sentences for all the experiments. All

the priors were chosen to be equal to 0.1. We used
15 local topics and 30 global topics. In the model,

the first three local topics were associated to the

rating classifiers for each aspects. As a result, we

would expect these topics to correspond to the ser-

vice, location, and rooms aspects respectively. Un-

igram and bigram features were used in the senti-

ment predictors in the MAS model. Before apply-

ing the topic models we removed punctuation and

also removed stop words using the standard list of

stop words,8 however, all the words and punctuation

were used in the sentiment predictors.

It does not take many chain iterations to discover

initial topics. This happens considerably faster than

the appropriate weights of the sentiment predictor

being learned. This poses a problem, because, in the

beginning, the sentiment predictors are not accurate

enough to force the model to discover appropriate

topics associated with each of the rated aspects. And

as soon as topic are formed, aspect sentiment predic-

tors cannot affect them anymore because they do not

8http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/idom/ir resources/linguistic utils/

stop words

have access to the true words associated with their

aspects. To combat this problem we first train the

sentiment classifiers by assuming that pa
f,r,z

is equal

for all the local topics, which effectively ignores the

topic model. Then we use the estimated parame-

ters within the topic model.9 Secondly, we mod-

ify the sampling algorithm. The conditional prob-

ability used in sampling, expression (2), is propor-

tional to the product of two factors. The first factor,

η
d,i
v,r,z , expresses a preference for topics likely from

the co-occurrence information, whereas the second

one, ρ
d,i
r,z , favors the choice of topics which are pre-

dictive of the observable sentiment ratings. We used

(ρ
d,i
r,z)

1+0.95tq in the sampling distribution instead of

ρ
d,i
r,z , where t is the iteration number. q was chosen

to be 4, though the quality of the topics seemed to
be indistinguishable with any q between 3 and 10.
This can be thought of as having 1 + 0.95tq ratings
instead of a single vector assigned to each review,

i.e., focusing the model on prediction of the ratings

rather than finding the topic labels which are good at

explaining co-occurrences of words. These heuris-

tics influence sampling only during the first itera-

tions of the chain.

Top words for some of discovered local topics, in-

9Initial experiments suggested that instead of doing this

‘pre-training’ we could start with very large priors α

mix, and then reduce them through the course of training.

However, this is significantly more computationally expensive.

cluding the first 3 topics associated with the rated as-

pects, and also top words for some of global topics

are presented in Table 1. We can see that the model

discovered as its first three topics the correct associ-

ated aspects: service, location, and rooms. Other lo-

cal topics, as for the MG-LDA model, correspond to

other aspects discussed in reviews (breakfast, prices,

noise), and as it was previously shown in Titov and

McDonald (2008), aspects for global topics corre-

spond to the types of reviewed items (hotels in Rus-

sia, Paris hotels) or background words.

Notice though, that the 3rd local topic induced for

the rating rooms is slightly narrow. This can be ex-

plained by the fact that the aspect rooms is a central

aspect of hotel reviews. A very significant fraction

of text in every review can be thought of as a part of

the aspect rooms. These portions of reviews discuss

different coherent sub-aspects related to the aspect

rooms, e.g., the previously discovered topic noise.

Therefore, it is natural to associate several topics to

such central aspects. To test this we varied the num-

ber of topics associated with the sentiment predictor

for the aspect rooms. Top words for resulting top-

ics are presented in Table 2. It can be observed that

the topic model discovered appropriate topics while

the number of topics was below 4. With 4 topics
a semantically unrelated topic (check-in/arrival) is

induced. Manual selection of the number of topics

is undesirable, but this problem can be potentially

tackled with Dirichlet Process priors or a topic split

criterion based on the accuracy of the sentiment pre-

dictor in the MAS model. We found that both ser-

vice and location did not benefit by the assignment

of additional topics to their sentiment rating models.

The experimental results suggest that the MAS

model is reliable in the discovery of topics corre-

sponding to the rated aspects. In the next section

we will show that the induced topics can be used to

accurately extract fragments for each aspect.

3.2 Sentence Labeling

A primary advantage of MAS over unsupervised

models, such as MG-LDA or clustering, is that top-

ics are linked to a rated aspect, i.e., we know ex-

actly which topics model which aspects. As a re-

sult, these topics can be directly used to extract tex-

tual mentions that are relevant for an aspect. To test

this, we hand labeled 779 random sentences from

the dataset considered in the previous set of experi-

ments. The sentences were labeled with one or more

aspects. Among them, 164, 176 and 263 sentences

were labeled as related to aspects service, location

and rooms, respectively. The remaining sentences

were not relevant to any of the rated aspects.

We compared two models. The first model uses

the first three topics of MAS to extract relevant men-

tions based on the probability of that topic/aspect be-

ing present in the sentence. To obtain these probabil-

ities we used estimators based on the proportion of

words in the sentence assigned to an aspects’ topic

and normalized within local topics. To improve the

reliability of the estimator we produced 100 sam-

ples for each document while keeping assignments

of the topics to all other words in the collection fixed.

The probability estimates were then obtained by av-

eraging over these samples. We did not perform

any model selection on the basis of the hand-labeled

data, and tested only a single model of each type.

For the second model we trained a maximum en-

tropy classifier, one per each aspect, using 10-fold

cross validation and unigram/bigram features. Note

that this is a supervised system and as such repre-

sents an upper-bound in performance one might ex-

pect when comparing an unsupervised model such

as MAS. We chose this comparison to demonstrate

that our model can find relevant text mentions with

high accuracy relative to a supervised model. It is

difficult to compare our model to other unsupervised

systems such as MG-LDA or LDA. Again, this is

because those systems have no mechanism for di-

rectly correlating topics or clusters to corresponding

aspects, highlighting the benefit of MAS.

The resulting precision-recall curves for the as-

pects service, location and rooms are presented

in Figure 4. In Figure 4c, we varied the number

of topics associated with the aspect rooms.10 The

average precision we obtained (the standard mea-

sure proportional to the area under the curve) is

75.8%, 85.5% for aspects service and location, re-

spectively. For the aspect rooms these scores are

equal to 75.0%, 74.5%, 87.6%, 79.8% with 1–4 top-

ics per aspect, respectively. The logistic regression

models achieve 80.8%, 94.0% and 88.3% for the as-

pects service, location and rooms. We can observe

that the topic model, which does not use any explic-

itly aspect-labeled text, achieves accuracies lower

than, but comparable to a supervised model.

4 Related Work

There is a growing body of work on summariz-

ing sentiment by extracting and aggregating senti-

ment over ratable aspects and providing correspond-

ing textual evidence. Text excerpts are usually ex-

tracted through string matching (Hu and Liu, 2004a;

Popescu and Etzioni, 2005), sentence clustering

(Gamon et al., 2005), or through topic models (Mei

et al., 2007; Titov and McDonald, 2008). String ex-

traction methods are limited to fine-grained aspects

whereas clustering and topic model approaches must

resort to ad-hoc means of labeling clusters or topics.

However, this is the first work we are aware of that

uses a pre-defined set of aspects plus an associated

signal to learn a mapping from text to an aspect for

the purpose of extraction.

A closely related model to ours is that of Mei et

al. (2007) which performs joint topic and sentiment

modeling of collections. Our model differs from

theirs in many respects: Mei et al. only model senti-

ment predictions for the entire document and not on

the aspect level; They treat sentiment predictions as

unobserved variables, whereas we treat them as ob-

served signals that help to guide the creation of top-

ics; They model co-occurrences solely on the docu-

ment level, whereas our model is based on MG-LDA

and models both local and global contexts.

Recently, Blei and McAuliffe (2008) proposed an

approach for joint sentiment and topic modeling that

can be viewed as a supervised LDA (sLDA) model

that tries to infer topics appropriate for use in a

given classification or regression problem. MAS and

sLDA are similar in that both use sentiment predic-

tions as an observed signal that is predicted by the

model. However, Blei et al. do not consider multi-

aspect ranking or look at co-occurrences beyond the

document level, both of which are central to our

model. Parallel to this study Branavan et al. (2008)

also showed that joint models of text and user anno-

tations benefit extractive summarization. In partic-

ular, they used signals from pros-cons lists whereas

our models use aspect rating signals.

5 Conclusions

In this paper we presented a joint model of text and

aspect ratings for extracting text to be displayed in

sentiment summaries. The model uses aspect ratings

to discover the corresponding topics and can thus ex-

tract fragments of text discussing these aspects with-

out the need of annotated data. We demonstrated

that the model indeed discovers corresponding co-

herent topics and achieves accuracy in sentence la-

beling comparable to a standard supervised model.

The primary area of future work is to incorporate the

model into an end-to-end sentiment summarization

system in order to evaluate it at that level.
