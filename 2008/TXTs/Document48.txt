Abstract

We propose using large-scale clustering of de-
pendency relations between verbs and multi-
word nouns (MNs) to construct a gazetteer for
named entity recognition (NER). Since depen-
dency relations capture the semantics of MNs
well, the MN clusters constructed by using
dependency relations should serve as a good
gazetteer. However, the high level of computa-
tional cost has prevented the use of clustering
for constructing gazetteers. We parallelized
a clustering algorithm based on expectation-
maximization (EM) and thus enabled the con-
struction of large-scale MN clusters. We
demonstrated with the IREX dataset for the
Japanese NER that using the constructed clus-
ters as a gazetteer (cluster gazetteer) is a effec-
tive way of improving the accuracy of NER.
Moreover, we demonstrate that the combina-
tion of the cluster gazetteer and a gazetteer ex-
tracted from Wikipedia, which is also useful
for NER, can further improve the accuracy in
several cases.

1 Introduction

Gazetteers, or entity dictionaries, are important for
performing named entity recognition (NER) accu-
rately. Since building and maintaining high-quality
gazetteers by hand is very expensive, many meth-
ods have been proposed for automatic extraction of
gazetteers from texts (Riloff and Jones, 1999; The-
len and Riloff, 2002; Etzioni et al., 2005; Shinzato et
al., 2006; Talukdar et al., 2006; Nadeau et al., 2006).

Most studies using gazetteers for NER are based
on the assumption that a gazetteer is a mapping

from a multi-word noun (MN)1 to named en-
tity categories such as “Tokyo Stock Exchange →
{ORGANIZATION}”.2 However, since the corre-
spondence between the labels and the NE categories
can be learned by tagging models, a gazetteer will be
useful as long as it returns consistent labels even if
those returned are not the NE categories. By chang-
ing the perspective in such a way, we can explore
more broad classes of gazetteers. For example, we
can use automatically extracted hyponymy relations
(Hearst, 1992; Shinzato and Torisawa, 2004), or au-
tomatically induced MN clusters (Rooth et al., 1999;
Torisawa, 2001).

For instance, Kazama and Torisawa (2007) used
the hyponymy relations extracted from Wikipedia
for the English NER, and reported improved accu-
racies with such a gazetteer.

We focused on the automatically induced clus-
ters of multi-word nouns (MNs) as the source of
gazetteers. We call the constructed gazetteers clus-
ter gazetteers. In the context of tagging, there are
several studies that utilized word clusters to prevent
the data sparseness problem (Kazama et al., 2001;
Miller et al., 2004). However, these methods cannot
produce the MN clusters required for constructing
gazetteers. In addition, the clustering methods used,
such as HMMs and Brown’s algorithm (Brown et
al., 1992), seem unable to adequately capture the se-
mantics of MNs since they are based only on the
information of adjacent words. We utilized richer

1We used the term, “multi-word”, to emphasize that a
gazetteer includes not only one-word expressions but also
multi-word expressions.

we assume that only one category is associated.

syntactic/semantic structures, i.e., verb-MN depen-
dencies to make clean MN clusters. Rooth et al.
(1999) and Torisawa (2001) showed that the EM-
based clustering using verb-MN dependencies can
produce semantically clean MN clusters. However,
the clustering algorithms, especially the EM-based
algorithms, are computationally expensive. There-
fore, performing the clustering with a vocabulary
that is large enough to cover the many named entities
required to improve the accuracy of NER is difficult.
We enabled such large-scale clustering by paralleliz-
ing the clustering algorithm, and we demonstrate the
usefulness of the gazetteer constructed.

We parallelized the algorithm of (Torisawa, 2001)
using the Message Passing Interface (MPI), with the
prime goal being to distribute parameters and thus
enable clustering with a large vocabulary. Apply-
ing the parallelized clustering to a large set of de-
pendencies collected from Web documents enabled
us to construct gazetteers with up to 500,000 entries
and 3,000 classes.

In our experiments, we used the IREX dataset
(Sekine and Isahara, 2000) to demonstrate the use-
fulness of cluster gazetteers. We also compared
the cluster gazetteers with the Wikipedia gazetteer
constructed by following the method of (Kazama
and Torisawa, 2007). The improvement was larger
for the cluster gazetteer than for the Wikipedia
gazetteer. We also investigated whether these
gazetteers improve the accuracies further when they
are used in combination. The experimental results
indicated that the accuracy improved further in sev-
eral cases and showed that these gazetteers comple-
ment each other.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2,
we explain the construction of cluster gazetteers and
its parallelization, along with a brief explanation of
the construction of the Wikipedia gazetteer. In Sec-
tion 3, we explain how to use these gazetteers as fea-
tures in an NE tagger. Our experimental results are
reported in Section 4.

2 Gazetteer Induction
2.1 Induction by MN Clustering
Assume we have a probabilistic model of a multi-
word noun (MN) and its class: p(n, c) =
p(n|c)p(c), where n ∈ N is an MN and c ∈ C is a
class. We can use this model to construct a gazetteer
in several ways. The method we used in this study

constructs a gazetteer: n → argmax
c

p(c|n). This
computation can be re-written by the Bayes rule as
argmax

c
p(n|c)p(c) using p(n|c) and p(c).

Note that we do not exclude non-NEs when we
construct the gazetteer. We expect that tagging
models (CRFs in our case) can learn an appropri-
ate weight for each gazetteer match regardless of
whether it is an NE or not.

2.2 EM-based Clustering using Dependency
Relations

To learn p(n|c) and p(c) for Japanese, we use the
EM-based clustering method presented by Torisawa
(2001). This method assumes a probabilistic model
of verb-MN dependencies with hidden semantic
classes:3

p(v, r, n) =
∑

c

p(〈v, r〉|c)p(n|c)p(c), (1)

where v ∈ V is a verb and n ∈ N is an MN that
depends on verb v with relation r. A relation, r,
is represented by Japanese postpositions attached to
n. For example, from the following Japanese sen-
tence, we extract the following dependency: v =
飲む (drink), r = を (”wo” postposition), n =
ビール (beer).

ビール (beer)を (wo)飲む (drink) (≈ drink beer)

In the following, we let vt ≡ 〈v, r〉 ∈ VT for the
simplicity of explanation.

To be precise, we attach various auxiliary verb
suffixes, such as “れる (reru)”, which is for pas-
sivization, into v, since these greatly change the type
of n in the dependent position. In addition, we also
treated the MN-MN expressions, “MN1 の MN2”
(≈ “MN2 of MN1”), as dependencies v = MN2,
r = の, n = MN1, since these expressions also
characterize the dependent MNs well.

Given L training examples of verb-MN depen-
dencies {(vti, ni, fi)}Li=1, where fi is the number
of dependency (vti, ni) in a corpus, the EM-based
clustering tries to find p(vt|c), p(n|c), and p(c) that
maximize the (log)-likelihood of the training exam-
ples:

LL(p) =
∑

i

fi log(
∑

c

p(vti|c)p(ni|c)p(c)). (2)

3This formulation is based on the formulation presented in
Rooth et al. (1999) for English.

We iteratively update the probabilities using the EM
algorithm. For the update procedures used, see Tori-
sawa (2001).

The corpus we used for collecting dependencies
was a large set (76 million) of Web documents,
that were processed by a dependency parser, KNP
(Kurohashi and Kawahara, 2005).4 From this cor-
pus, we extracted about 380 million dependencies
of the form {(vti, ni, fi)}Li .

2.3 Parallelization for Large-scale Data

The disadvantage of the clustering algorithm de-
scribed above is the computational costs. The space
requirements are O(|VT ||C|+ |N ||C|+ |C|) for stor-
ing the parameters, p(vt|c), p(n|c), and p(c)5, plus
O(L) for storing the training examples. The time
complexity is mainly O(L × |C| × I), where I is
the number of update iterations. The space require-
ments are the main limiting factor. Assume that a
floating-point number consumes 8 bytes. With the
setting, |N | = 500, 000, |VT | = 500, 000, and
|C| = 3, 000, the algorithm requires more than 44
GB for the parameters and 4 GB of memory for the
training examples. A machine with more than 48
GB of memory is not widely available even today.

Therefore, we parallelized the clustering algo-
rithm, to make it suitable for running on a cluster
of PCs with a moderate amount of memory (e.g., 8
GB). First, we decided to store the training examples
on a file since otherwise each node would need to
store all the examples when we use the data splitting
described below, and having every node consume 4
GB of memory is memory-consuming. Since the ac-
cess to the training data is sequential, this does not
slow down the execution when we use a buffering
technique appropriately.6

We then split the matrix for the model parameters,
p(n|c) and p(vt|c), along with the class coordinate.
That is, each cluster node is responsible for storing
only a part of classes Cl, i.e., 1/|P | of the parame-
ter matrix, where P is the number of cluster nodes.
This data splitting enables linear scalability of mem-
ory sizes. However, doing so complicates the update
procedure and, in terms of execution speed, may

5To be precise, we need two copies of these.
6Each node has a copy of the training data on a local disk.

for cl ∈ Cl do

ing algorithm. Each node executes this code in parallel.

offset the advantage of parallelization because each
node needs to receive information about the classes
that are not on the node in the inner-most routine of
the update procedure.

The inner-most routine should compute:

p(c|vti, ni) = p(vti|c)p(ni|c)p(c)/Z, (3)

for each class c, where Z =
∑

c p(vti|c)p(ni|c)p(c)
is a normalizing constant. However, Z cannot be
calculated without knowing the results of other clus-
ter nodes. Thus, if we use MPI for parallelization,
the parallelized version of this routine should re-
semble the algorithm shown in Figure 1. This rou-
tine first computes p(vti|cl)p(ni|cl)p(cl) for each
cl ∈ Cl, and stores the sum of these values as localZ.
The routine uses an MPI function, MPI Allreduce,
to sum up localZ of the all cluster nodes and to
set Z with the resulting sum. We can compute
p(cl|vti, ni) by using this Z to normalize the value.
Although the above is the essence of our paralleliza-
tion, invoking MPI Allreduce in the inner-most loop
is very expensive because the communication setup
is not so cheap. Therefore, our implementation cal-
culates p(cl|vti, ni) in batches of B examples and
calls MPI Allreduce at every B examples.7 We used
a value of B = 4, 096 in this study.

By using this parallelization, we successfully per-
formed the clustering with |N | = 500, 000, |VT | =
500, 000, |C| = 3, 000, and I = 150, on 8 clus-
ter nodes with a 2.6 GHz Opteron processor and 8
GB of memory. This clustering took about a week.
To our knowledge, no one else has performed EM-
based clustering of this type on this scale. The re-
sulting MN clusters are shown in Figure 2. In terms
of speed, our experiments are still at a preliminary

7MPI Allreduce can also take array arguments and apply the
operation to each element of the array in one call.

2.4 Induction from Wikipedia
Defining sentences in a dictionary or an encyclope-
dia have long been used as a source of hyponymy re-
lations (Tsurumaru et al., 1991; Herbelot and Copes-
take, 2006).

Kazama and Torisawa (2007) extracted hy-
ponymy relations from the first sentences (i.e., defin-
ing sentences) of Wikipedia articles and then used
them as a gazetteer for NER. We used this method
to construct the Wikipedia gazetteer.

The method described by Kazama and Torisawa
(2007) is to first extract the first (base) noun phrase
after the first “is”, “was”, “are”, or “were” in the first
sentence of a Wikipedia article. The last word in the
noun phase is then extracted and becomes the hyper-
nym of the entity described by the article. For exam-
ple, from the following defining sentence, it extracts
“guitarist” as the hypernym for “Jimi Hendrix”.

Jimi Hendrix (November 27, 1942) was an Ameri-
can guitarist, singer and songwriter.

The second noun phrase is used when the first noun
phrase ends with “one”, “kind”, “sort”, or “type”,
or it ended with “name” followed by “of”. This
rule is for treating expressions like “... is one of
the landlocked countries.” By applying this method
of extraction to all the articles in Wikipedia, we

Table 1: Wikipedia gazetteer extraction

construct a gazetteer that maps an MN (a title of a
Wikipedia article) to its hypernym.8 When the hy-
pernym extraction failed, a special hypernym sym-
bol, e.g., “UNK”, was used.

We modified this method for Japanese. After pre-
processing the first sentence of an article using a
morphological analyzer, MeCab9, we extracted the
last noun after the appearance of Japanese postpo-
sition “は (wa)” (≈ “is”). As in the English case,
we also refrained from extracting expressions corre-
sponding to “one of” and so on.

From the Japanese Wikipedia entries of April
10, 2007, we extracted 550,832 gazetteer entries
(482,599 entries have hypernyms other than UNK).
Various statistics for this extraction are shown in
Table 1. The number of distinct hypernyms in
the gazetteer was 12,786. Although this Wikipedia
gazetteer is much smaller than the English version
used by Kazama and Torisawa (2007) that has over
2,000,000 entries, it is the largest gazetteer that can
be freely used for Japanese NER. Our experimen-
tal results show that this Wikipedia gazetteer can be
used to improve the accuracy of Japanese NER.

3 Using Gazetteers as Features of NER

Since Japanese has no spaces between words, there
are several choices for the token unit used in NER.
Asahara and Motsumoto (2003) proposed using
characters instead of morphemes as the unit to alle-
viate the effect of segmentation errors in morpholog-
ical analysis and we also used their character-based
method. The NER task is then treated as a tagging
task, which assigns IOB tags to each character in
a sentence.10 We use Conditional Random Fields
(CRFs) (Lafferty et al., 2001) to perform this tag-
ging.

The information of a gazetteer is incorporated
8They handled “redirections” as well by following redirec-

tion links and extracting a hypernym from the article reached.

as features in a CRF-based NE tagger. We follow
the method used by Kazama and Torisawa (2007),
which encodes the matching with a gazetteer entity
using IOB tags, with the modification for Japanese.
They describe using two types of gazetteer features.
The first is a matching-only feature, which uses
bare IOB tags to encode only matching information.
The second uses IOB tags that are augmented with
classes (e.g., B-country and I-country).11 When
there are several possibilities for making a match,
the left-most longest match is selected. The small
differences from their work are: (1) We used char-
acters as the unit as we described above, (2) While
Kazama and Torisawa (2007) checked only the word
sequences that start with a capitalized word and thus
exploited the characteristics of English language, we
checked the matching at every character, (3) We
used a TRIE to make the look-up efficient.

The output of gazetteer features for Japanese NER
are thus as those shown in Figure 3. These annotated
IOB tags can be used in the same way as other fea-
tures in a CRF tagger.

4.1 Data

We used the CRL NE dataset provided in the
IREX competition (Sekine and Isahara, 2000). In
the dataset, 1,174 newspaper articles are annotated
with 8 NE categories: ARTIFACT, DATE, LO-
CATION, MONEY, ORGANIZATION, PERCENT,
PERSON, and TIME.12 We converted the data into
the CoNLL 2003 format, i.e., each row corresponds
to a character in this case. We obtained 11,892 sen-
tences13 with 18,677 named entities. We split this
data into the training set (9,000 sentences), the de-

11Here, we call the value returned by a gazetteer a “class”.
Features are not output when the returned class is UNK in the
case of the Wikipedia gazetteer. We did not observe any signif-
icant change if we also used UNK.

velopment set (1,446 sentences), and the testing set
(1,446 sentences).

4.2 Baseline Model
We extracted the atomic features listed in Table 2
at each character for our baseline model. Though
there may be slight differences, these features are
based on the standard ones proposed and used in
previous studies on Japanese NER such as those by
Asahara and Motsumoto (2003), Nakano and Hirai
(2004), and Yamada (2007). We used MeCab as a
morphological analyzer and CaboCha14 (Kudo and
Matsumoto, 2002) as the dependency parser to find
the boundaries of the bunsetsu. We generated the
node and the edge features of a CRF model as de-
scribed in Table 3 using these atomic features.

4.3 Training
To train CRF models, we used Taku Kudo’s CRF++

used Gaussian regularization to prevent overfitting.
The parameter of the Gaussian, σ2, was tuned us-
ing the development set. We tested 10 points:
{0.64, 1.28, 2.56, 5.12, . . . , 163.84, 327.68}. We
stopped training when the relative change in the log-
likelihood became less than a pre-defined threshold,
0.0001. Throughout the experiments, we omitted
the features whose surface part described in Table
3 occurred less than twice in the training corpus.

4.4 Effect of Gazetteer Features

We investigated the effect of the cluster gazetteer de-
scribed in Section 2.1 and the Wikipedia gazetteer
described in Section 2.4, by adding each gazetteer
to the baseline model. We added the matching-
only and the class-augmented features, and we gen-
erated the node and the edge features in Table 3.17

For the cluster gazetteer, we made several gazetteers
that had different vocabulary sizes and numbers of
classes. The number of clustering iterations was 150
and the initial parameters were set randomly with a
Dirichlet distribution (αi = 1.0).

The statistics of each gazetteer are summarized
in Table 4. The number of entries in a gazetteer is
given by “# entries”, and “# matches” is the number
of matches that were output for the training set. We
define “# e-matches” as the number of matches that
also match a boundary of a named entity in the train-
ing set, and “# optimal” as the optimal number of “#
e-matches” that can be achieved when we know the

oracle of entity boundaries. Note that this cannot
be realized because our matching uses the left-most
longest heuristics. We define “pre.” as the precision
of the output matches (i.e., # e-matches/# matches),
and “rec.” as the recall (i.e., # e-matches/# NEs).
Here, # NEs = 14, 056. Finally, “opt.” is the op-
timal recall (i.e., # optimal/# NEs). “# classes” is
the number of distinct classes in a gazetteer, and
“# used” is the number of classes that were out-
put for the training set. Gazetteers are as follows:
“wikip(m)” is the Wikipedia gazetteer (matching
only), and “wikip(c)” is the Wikipedia gazetteer
(with class-augmentation). A cluster gazetteer,
which is constructed by the clustering with |N | =
|VT | = X × 1, 000 and |C| = Y × 1, 000, is indi-
cated by “cXk-Y k”. Note that “# entries” is slightly
smaller than the vocabulary size since we removed
some duplications during the conversion to a TRIE.

These gazetteers cover 40 - 50% of the named en-
tities, and the cluster gazetteers have relatively wider
coverage than the Wikipedia gazetteer has. The pre-
cisions are very low because there are many erro-
neous matches, e.g., with a entries for a hiragana
character.18 Although this seems to be a serious
problem, removing such one-character entries does
not affect the accuracy, and in fact, makes it worsen
slightly. We think this shows one of the strengths
of machine learning methods such as CRFs. We can
also see that our current matching method is not an
optimal one. For example, 16% of the matches were
lost as a result of using our left-most longest heuris-
tics for the case of the c500k-2k gazetteer.

A comparison of the effect of these gazetteers is
shown in Table 5. The performance is measured
by the F-measure. First, the Wikipedia gazetteer
improved the accuracy as expected, i.e., it repro-
duced the result of Kazama and Torisawa (2007)
for Japanese NER. The improvement for the test-
ing set was 1.08 points. Second, all the tested clus-
ter gazetteers improved the accuracy. The largest
improvement was 1.55 points with the c300k-3k
gazetteer. This was larger than that of the Wikipedia
gazetteer. The results for c300k-Y k gazetteers show
a peak of the improvement at some number of clus-
ters. In this case, |C| = 3, 000 achieved the best
improvement. The results of cXk-2k gazetteers in-

18Wikipedia contains articles explaining each hiragana char-
acter, e.g., “あ is a hiragana character”.

dicate that the larger a gazetteer is, the larger the im-
provement. However, the accuracies of the c300k-3k
and c500k-3k gazetteers seem to contradict this ten-
dency. It might be caused by the accidental low qual-
ity of the clustering that results from random initial-
ization. We need to investigate this further.

4.5 Effect of Combining the Cluster and the
Wikipedia Gazetteers

We have observed that using the cluster gazetteer
and the Wikipedia one improves the accuracy of
Japanese NER. The next question is whether these
gazetteers improve the accuracy further when they
are used together. The accuracies of models that
use the Wikipedia gazetteer and one of the cluster
gazetteers at the same time are shown in Table 6.
The accuracy was improved in most cases. How-

ever, there were some cases where the accuracy for
the development set was degraded. Therefore, we
should state at this point that while the benefit of
combining these gazetteers is not consistent in a
strict sense, it seems to exist. The best performance,
F = 89.26 (dev.) / 89.19 (test.), was achieved when
we combined the Wikipedia gazetteer and the clus-
ter gazetteer, c500k-2k. This means that there was
a 1.77-point improvement from the baseline for the
testing set.

5 Comparison with Previous Studies

Since many previous studies on Japanese NER used
5-fold cross validation for the IREX dataset, we
also performed it for some our models that had the
best σ2 found in the previous experiments. The re-
sults are listed in Table 7 with references to the re-
sults of recent studies. These results not only re-
confirmed the effects of the gazetteer features shown
in the previous experiments, but they also showed
that our best model is comparable to the state-of-the-
art models. The system recently proposed by Sasano
and Kurohashi (2008) is currently the best system
for the IREX dataset. It uses many structural fea-
tures that are not used in our model. Incorporating

such features might improve our model further.

6 Related Work and Discussion

There are several studies that used automatically ex-
tracted gazetteers for NER (Shinzato et al., 2006;
Talukdar et al., 2006; Nadeau et al., 2006; Kazama
and Torisawa, 2007). Most of the methods (Shin-
zato et al., 2006; Talukdar et al., 2006; Nadeau et
al., 2006) are oriented at the NE category. They
extracted a gazetteer for each NE category and uti-
lized it in a NE tagger. On the other hand, Kazama
and Torisawa (2007) extracted hyponymy relations,
which are independent of the NE categories, from
Wikipedia and utilized it as a gazetteer. The ef-
fectiveness of this method was demonstrated for
Japanese NER as well by this study.

Inducing features for taggers by clustering has
been tried by several researchers (Kazama et al.,
2001; Miller et al., 2004). They constructed word
clusters by using HMMs or Brown’s clustering algo-
rithm (Brown et al., 1992), which utilize only infor-
mation from neighboring words. This study, on the
other hand, utilized MN clustering based on verb-
MN dependencies (Rooth et al., 1999; Torisawa,
2001). We showed that gazetteers created by using
such richer semantic/syntactic structures improves
the accuracy for NER.

The size of the gazetteers is also a novel point of
this study. The previous studies, with the excep-
tion of Kazama and Torisawa (2007), used smaller
gazetteers than ours. Shinzato et al. (2006) con-
structed gazetteers with about 100,000 entries in
total for the “restaurant” domain; Talukdar et al.
(2006) used gazetteers with about 120,000 entries
in total, and Nadeau et al. (2006) used gazetteers
with about 85,000 entries in total. By paralleliz-
ing the clustering algorithm, we successfully con-
structed a cluster gazetteer with up to 500,000 en-
tries from a large amount of dependency relations
in Web documents. To our knowledge, no one else
has performed this type of clustering on such a large
scale. Wikipedia also produced a large gazetteer
of more than 550,000 entries. However, compar-
ing these gazetteers and ours precisely is difficult at
this point because the detailed information such as
the precision and the recall of these gazetteers were
not reported.19 Recently, Inui et al. (2007) investi-

19Shinzato et al. (2006) reported some useful statistics about

gated the relation between the size and the quality of
a gazetteer and its effect. We think this is one of the
important directions of future research.

Parallelization has recently regained attention in
the machine learning community because of the
need for learning from very large sets of data. Chu
et al. (2006) presented the MapReduce framework
for a wide range of machine learning algorithms, in-
cluding the EM algorithm. Newman et al. (2007)
presented parallelized Latent Dirichlet Allocation
(LDA). However, these studies focus on the distri-
bution of the training examples and relevant com-
putation, and ignore the need that we found for the
distribution of model parameters. The exception,
which we noticed recently, is a study by Wolfe et
al. (2007), which describes how each node stores
only those parameters relevant to the training data
on each node. However, some parameters need to
be duplicated and thus their method is less efficient
than ours in terms of memory usage.

We used the left-most longest heuristics to find
the matching gazetteer entries. However, as shown
in Table 4 this is not an optimal method. We need
more sophisticated matching methods that can han-
dle multiple matching possibilities. Using models
such as Semi-Markov CRFs (Sarawagi and Cohen,
2004), which handle the features on overlapping re-
gions, is one possible direction. However, even if
we utilize the current gazetteers optimally, the cov-
erage is upper bounded at 70%. To cover most of
the named entities in the data, we need much larger
gazetteers. A straightforward approach is to increase
the number of Web documents used for the MN clus-
tering and to use larger vocabularies.

7 Conclusion

We demonstrated that a gazetteer obtained by clus-
tering verb-MN dependencies is a useful feature
for a Japanese NER. In addition, we demonstrated
that using the cluster gazetteer and the gazetteer ex-
tracted from Wikipedia (also shown to be useful)
can together further improves the accuracy in sev-
eral cases. Future work will be to refine the match-
ing method and to construct even larger gazetteers.

their gazetteers.
