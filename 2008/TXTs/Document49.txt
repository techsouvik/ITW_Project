Abstract

Roget’s Thesaurus has gone through many re-
visions since it was first published 150 years
ago. But how do these revisions affect Ro-
get’s usefulness for NLP? We examine the
differences in content between the 1911 and
1987 versions of Roget’s, and we test both ver-
sions with each other and WordNet on prob-
lems such as synonym identification and word
relatedness. We also present a novel method
for measuring sentence relatedness that can be
implemented in either version of Roget’s or in
WordNet. Although the 1987 version of the
Thesaurus is better, we show that the 1911 ver-
sion performs surprisingly well and that often
the differences between the versions of Ro-
get’s and WordNet are not statistically signif-
icant. We hope that this work will encourage
others to use the 1911 Roget’s Thesaurus in
NLP tasks.

1 Introduction

Roget’s Thesaurus, first introduced over 150 years
ago, has gone through many revisions to reach its
current state. We compare two versions, the 1987
and 1911 editions of the Thesaurus with each other
and with WordNet 3.0. Roget’s Thesaurus has a
unique structure, quite different from WordNet, of
which the NLP community has yet to take full ad-
vantage. In this paper we demonstrate that although
the 1911 version of the Thesaurus is very old, it can
give results comparable to systems that use WordNet
or newer versions of Roget’s Thesaurus.

The main motivation for working with the 1911
Thesaurus instead of newer versions is that it is in

the public domain, along with related NLP-oriented
software packages. For applications that call for an
NLP-friendly thesaurus, WordNet has become the
de-facto standard. Although WordNet is a fine re-
sources, we believe that ignoring other thesauri is
a serious oversight. We show on three applications
how useful the 1911 Thesaurus is. We ran the well-
established tasks of determining semantic related-
ness of pairs of terms and identifying synonyms (Jar-
masz and Szpakowicz, 2004). We also proposed
a new method of representing the meaning of sen-
tences or other short texts using either WordNet or
Roget’s Thesaurus, and tested it on the data set pro-
vided by Li et al. (2006). We hope that this work
will encourage others to use Roget’s Thesaurus in
their own NLP tasks.

Previous research on the 1987 version of Roget’s
Thesaurus includes work of Jarmasz and Szpakow-
icz (2004). They propose a method of determin-
ing semantic relatedness between pairs of terms.
Terms that appear closer together in the Thesaurus
get higher weights than those farther apart. The
experiments aimed at identifying synonyms using
a modified version of the proposed semantic sim-
ilarity function. Similar experiments were carried
out using WordNet in combination with a variety of
semantic relatedness functions. Roget’s Thesaurus
was found generally to outperform WordNet on these
problems. We have run similar experiments using
the 1911Thesaurus.

Lexical chains have also been developed using the
1987 Roget’s Thesaurus (Jarmasz and Szpakowicz,
2003). The procedure maps words in a text to the
Head (a Roget’s concept) from which they are most
likely to come. Although we did not experiment

416



with lexical chains here, they were an inspiration for
our sentence relatedness function.

Roget’s Thesaurus does not explicitly label the
relations between its terms, as WordNet does. In-
stead, it groups terms together with implied rela-
tions. Kennedy and Szpakowicz (2007) show how
disambiguating one of these relations, hypernymy,
can help improve the semantic similarity functions
in (Jarmasz and Szpakowicz, 2004). These hyper-
nym relations were also put towards solving analogy
questions.

This is not the first time the 1911 version of Ro-
get’s Thesaurus has been used in NLP research. Cas-
sidy (2000) used it to build the semantic network
FACTOTUM. This required significant (manual) re-
structuring, so FACTOTUM cannot really be con-
sidered a true version of Roget’s Thesaurus.

The 1987 data come from Penguin’s Roget’s The-
saurus (Kirkpatrick, 1987). The 1911 version is
available from Project Gutenberg1. We use WordNet
3.0, the latest version (Fellbaum, 1998). In the ex-
periments we present here, we worked with an inter-
face to Roget’s Thesaurus implemented in Java 5.02.
It is built around a large index which stores the lo-
cation in the thesaurus of each word or phrase; the
system individually indexes all words within each
phrase, as well as the phrase itself. This was shown
to improve results in a few applications, which we
will discuss later in the paper.

2 Content comparison of the 1911 and
1987 Thesauri

Although the 1987 and 1911 Thesauri are very sim-
ilar in structure, there are a few differences, among
them, the number of levels and the number of parts-
of-speech represented. For example, the 1911 ver-
sion contains some pronouns as well as more sec-
tions dedicated to phrases.

There are nine levels in Roget’s Thesaurus hierar-
chy, from Class down to Word. We show them in
Table 1 along with the counts of instances of each
level. An example of a Class in the 1911 Thesaurus
is “Words Expressing Abstract Relations”, a Section
in that Class is “Quantity” with a Subsection “Com-
parative Quantity”. Heads can be thought of as the
heart of the Thesaurus because it is at this level that

the lexical material, organized into approximately a
thousand concepts, resides. Head Groups often pair
up opposites, for example Head #1 “Existence” and
Head #2 “Nonexistence” are found in the same Head
Group in both versions of the Thesaurus. Terms in
the Thesaurus may be labelled with cross-references
to other words in different Heads. We did not use
these references in our experiments.

The part-of-speech level is a little confusing, since
clearly no such grouping contains an exhaustive list
of all nouns, all verbs etc. We will write “POS” to in-
dicate a structure in Roget’s and “part-of-speech” to
indicate the word category in general. The four main
parts-of-speech represented in a POS are nouns,
verbs, adjectives and adverbs. Interjections are also
included in both the 1911 and 1987 thesauri; they are
usually phrases followed by an exclamation mark,
such as “for God’s sake!” and “pshaw!”. The Para-
graph and Semicolon Group are not given names,
but can often be represented by the first word.

The 1911 version also contains phrases (mostly
quotations), prefixes and pronouns. There are only
three prefixes – “tri-”, “tris-”, “laevo-” – and six pro-
nouns – “he”, “him”, “his”, “she”, “her”, “hers”.

Table 2 shows the frequency of paragraphs, semi-
colon groups and both total and unique words in a
given type of POS. Many terms occur both in the
1911 and 1987 Thesauri, but many more are unique
to either. Surprisingly, quite a few 1911 terms do not
appear in the 1987 data, as shown in Table 3; many
of them may have been considered obsolete and thus
dropped from the 1987 version. For example “in-
grafted” appears in the same semicolon group as

“implanted” in the older but not the newer version.
Some mismatches may be due to small changes in
spelling, for example, “Nirvana” is capitalized in the
1911 version, but not in the 1987 version.

The lexical data in Project Gutenberg’s 1911 Ro-
get’s appear to have been somewhat added to. For
example, the citation “Go ahead, make my day!”
from the 1971 movie Dirty Harry appears twice (in
Heads #715-Defiance and #761-Prohibition) within
the Phrase POS. It is not clear to what extent new
terms have been added to the original 1911 Roget’s
Thesaurus, or what the criteria for adding such new
elements could have been.

In the end, there are many differences between the
1987 and 1911 Roget’s Thesauri, primarily in con-

tent rather than in structure. The 1987 Thesaurus is
largely an expansion of the 1911 version, with three
POSs (phrases, pronouns and prefixes) removed.

3 Comparison on applications

In this section we consider how the two versions of
Roget’s Thesaurus and WordNet perform in three ap-
plications – measuring word relatedness, synonym
identification, and sentence relatedness.

3.1 Word relatedness
Relatedness can be measured by the closeness of the
words or phrases – henceforth referred to as terms –
in the structure of the thesaurus. Two terms in the
same semicolon group score 16, in the same para-
graph – 14, and so on (Jarmasz and Szpakowicz,
2004). The score is 0 if the terms appear in differ-
ent classes, or if either is missing. Pairs of terms get
higher scores for being closer together. When there
are multiple senses of two terms A and B, we want
to select senses a ∈ A and b ∈ B that maximize the
relatedness score. We define a distance function:

semDist(A,B) = max
a∈A,b∈B

2 ∗ (depth(lca(a, b)))

lca is the lowest common ancestor and depth is the
depth in the Roget’s hierarchy; a Class has depth 0,
Section 1, ..., Semicolon Group 8. If we think of the
function as counting edges between concepts in the
Roget’s hierarchy, then it could also be written as:

semDist(A,B) = max
a∈A,b∈B

16−edgesBetween(a, b)

We do not count links between words in the same
semicolon group, so in effect these methods find
distances between semicolon groups, that is to say,
these two functions will give the same results.

The 1911 and 1987 Thesauri were compared
with WordNet 3.0 on the three data sets contain-
ing pairs of words with manually assigned similarity
scores: 30 pairs (Miller and Charles, 1991), 65 pairs
(Rubenstein and Goodenough, 1965) and 353 pairs3

(Finkelstein et al., 2001). We assume that all terms
are nouns, so that we can have a fair comparison
of the two Thesauri with WordNet. We measure the
correlation with Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient.

A preliminary experiment set out to determine
whether there is any advantage to indexing the words
in a phrase separately, for example, whether the
phrase “change of direction” should be indexed only
as a whole, or as all of “change”, “of”, “direction”
and “change of direction”. The outcome of this ex-
periment appears in Table 4. There is a clear im-
provement: breaking phrases up gives superior re-
sults on all three data sets, for both versions of Ro-
get’s. In the remaining experiments, we have each
word in a phrase indexed.

We compare the results for the 1911 and 1987
Roget’s Thesauri with a variety of WordNet-based
semantic relatedness measures – see Table 5. We
consider 10 measures, noted in the table as J&C
(Jiang and Conrath, 1997), Resnik (Resnik, 1995),
Lin (Lin, 1998), W&P (Wu and Palmer, 1994),
L&C (Leacock and Chodorow, 1998), H&SO (Hirst
and St-Onge, 1998), Path (counts edges between
synsets), Lesk (Banerjee and Pedersen, 2002), and
finally Vector and Vector Pair (Patwardhan, 2003).
The latter two work with large vectors of co-
occurring terms from a corpus, so WordNet is only
part of the system. We used Pedersen’s Semantic
Distance software package (Pedersen et al., 2004).

The results suggest that neither version of Ro-
get’s is best for these data sets. In fact, the Vector
method is superior on all three sets, and the Lesk
algorithm performs very closely to Roget’s 1987.
Even on the largest set (Finkelstein et al., 2001),
however, the differences between Roget’s Thesaurus
and the Vector method are not statistically signifi-
cant at the p < 0.05 level for either thesaurus on
a two-tailed test4. The difference between the 1911
Thesaurus and Vector would be statistically signifi-

On the (Miller and Charles, 1991) and (Ruben-

stein and Goodenough, 1965) data sets the best sys-
tem did not show a statistically significant improve-
ment over the 1911 or 1987 Roget’s Thesauri, even
at p < 0.1 for a two-tailed test. These data sets are
too small for a meaningful comparison of systems
with close correlation scores.

3.2 Synonym identification
In this problem we take a term q and we seek the
correct synonym s from a setC. There are two steps.
We used the system from (Jarmasz and Szpakowicz,
2004) for identifying synonyms with Roget’s. First
we find a set of terms B ⊆ C with the maximum
relatedness between q and each term x ∈ C:

B = {x | argmax
x∈C

semDist(x, q)}

Next, we take the set of terms A ⊆ B where each
a ∈ A has the maximum number of shortest paths
between a and q.

A = {x | argmax
x∈B

numberShortestPaths(x, q)}

If s ∈ A and |A| = 1, the correct synonym has been
selected. Often the sets A and B will contain just
one item. If s ∈ A and |A| > 1, there is a tie. If
s /∈ A then the selected synonyms are incorrect. If
a multi-word phrase c ∈ C of length n is not found,

it is replaced by each of its words c1, c2..., cn, and
each of these words is considered in turn. The ci
that is closest to q is chosen to represent c. When
searching for a word in Roget’s or WordNet, we look
for all forms of the word.

The results of these experiments appear in Ta-
ble 6. “Yes” indicates correct answers, “No” – in-
correct answers, and “Tie” is for ties. QNF stands
for “Question word Not Found”, ANF for “Answer
word Not Found” and ONF for “Other word Not
Found”. We used three data sets for this applica-
tion: 80 questions taken from the Test of English as a
Foreign Language (TOEFL) (Landauer and Dumais,
1997), 50 questions – from the English as a Second
Language test (ESL) (Turney, 2001) and 300 ques-
tions – from the Reader’s Digest Word Power Game
(RDWP) (Lewis, 2000 and 2001).

Lesk and the Vector-based systems perform bet-
ter than all others, including Roget’s 1911 and 1987.
Even so, both versions of Roget’s Thesaurus per-
formed well, and were never worse than the worst
WordNet systems. In fact, six of the ten Word-
Net-based methods are consistently worse than the
1911 Thesaurus. Since the two Vector-based sys-
tems make use of additional data beyond WordNet,
Lesk is the only completely WordNet-based system
to outperform Roget’s 1987. One advantage of Ro-
get’s Thesaurus is that both versions generally have
fewer missing terms than WordNet, though Lesk,
Hirst & St-Onge and the two vector based methods
had fewer missing terms than Roget’s. This may be
because the other WordNet methods will only work
for nouns and verbs.

3.3 Sentence relatedness

Our final experiment concerns sentence relatedness.
We worked with a data set from (Li et al., 2006)5.
They took a subset of the term pairs from (Ruben-
stein and Goodenough, 1965) and chose sentences
to represent these terms; the sentences are defini-
tions from the Collins Cobuild dictionary (Sinclair,
2001). Thirty people were then asked to assign re-
latedness scores to these sentences, and the average
of these similarities was taken for each sentence.

Other methods of determining sentence seman-
tic relatedness expand term relatedness functions to

SentenceResults.htm

420



create a sentence relatedness function (Islam and
Inkpen, 2007; Mihalcea et al., 2006). We propose
to approach the task by exploiting in other ways the
commonalities in the structure of Roget’s Thesaurus
and of WordNet. We use the OpenNLP toolkit6 for
segmentation and part-of-speech tagging.

We use a method of sentence representation that
involves mapping the sentence into weighted con-
cepts in either Roget’s or WordNet. We mean a
concept in Roget’s to be either a Class, Section, ...,
Semicolon Group, while a concept in WordNet is any
synset. Essentially a concept is a grouping of words
from either resource. Concepts are weighted by two
criteria. The first is how frequently words from the
sentence appear in these concepts. The second is the
depth (or specificity) of the concept itself.

3.3.1 Weighting based on word frequency
Each word and punctuation mark w in a sentence

is given a score of 1. (Naturally, only open-category
words will be found in the thesaurus.) If w has n
word senses w1, ..., wn, each sense gets a score of
1/n, so that 1/n is added to each concept in the
Roget’s hierarchy (semicolon group, paragraph, ...,
class) or WordNet hierarchy that contains wi. We
weight concepts in this way simply because, unable
to determine which sense is correct, we assume that
all senses are equally probable. Each concept in Ro-
get’s Thesaurus and WordNet gets the sum of the
scores of the concepts below it in its hierarchy.

We will define the scores recursively for a concept
c in a sentence s and sub-concepts ci. For example,
in Roget’s if the concept c were a Class, then each ci
would be a Section. Likewise, in WordNet if c were
a synset, then each ci would be a hyponym synset of
c. Obviously if c is a word sense wi (a word in either
a synset or a Semicolon Group), then there can be no
sub-concepts ci. When c = wi, the score for c is the
sum of all occurrences of the word w in sentence s
divided by the number of senses of the word w.

score(c, s) =

{
instancesOf(w,s)

sensesOf(w)
if c = wi∑

ci∈c score(ci, s) otherwise

See Table 7 for an example of how this sentence
representation works. The sentence “A gem is a
jewel or stone that is used in jewellery.” is repre-
sented using the 1911 Roget’s. A concept is identi-

6http://opennlp.sourceforge.net

fied by a name and a series of up to 9 numbers that
indicate where in the thesaurus it appears. The first
number represents the Class, the second the Sec-
tion, ..., the ninth the word. We only show con-
cepts with weights greater than 1.0. Words not in
the thesaurus keep a weight of 1.0, but this weight
will not increase the weight of any concepts in Ro-
get’s or WordNet. Apart from the function words
“or”, “in”, “that” and “a” and the period, only the
word “jewellery” had a weight above 1.0. The cat-
egories labelled 6, 6.2 and 6.2.2 are the only an-
cestors of the word “use” that ended up with the
weights above 1.0. The words “gem”, “is”, “jewel”,
“stone” and “used” all contributed weight to the cat-
egories shown in Table 7, and to some categories
with weights lower than 1.0, but no sense of the
words themselves had a weight greater than 1.0.

It is worth noting that this method only relies on
the hierarchies in Roget’s and WordNet. We do not
take advantage of other WordNet relations such as
hyponymy, nor do we use any cross-reference links
that exist in Roget’s Thesaurus. Including such re-
lations might improve our sentence relatedness sys-
tem, but that has been left for future work.

3.3.2 Weighting based on specificity
To determine sentence relatedness, one could, for

example, flatten the structures like those in Table 7
into vectors and measure their closeness by some
vector distance function such as cosine similarity.
There is a problem with this, though. A concept in-
herits the weights of all its sub-concepts, so the con-
cepts that appear closer to the root of the tree will far
outweigh others. Some sort of weighting function
should be used to re-adjust the weights of particular
concepts. Were this an Information Retrieval task,
weighting schemes such as tf.idf for each concept
could apply, but for sentence relatedness we propose
an ad hoc weighting scheme based on assumptions
about which concepts are most important to sentence
representation. This weighting scheme is the second
element of our sentence relatedness function.

We weight a concept in Roget’s and in WordNet
by how many words in a sentence give weight to it.
We need to re-weight it based on how specific it is.
Clearly, concepts near the leaves of the hierarchy are
more specific than those close to the root of the hier-
archy. We define specificity as the distance in levels
between a given word and each concept found above

it in the hierarchy. In Roget’s Thesaurus there are ex-
actly 9 levels from the term to the class. In WordNet
there will be as many levels as a word has ances-
tors up the hypernymy chain. In Roget’s, a term has
specificity 1, a Semicolon Group 2, a Paragraph 3,
..., a Class 9. In WordNet, the specificity of a word
is 1, its synset – 2, the synset’s hypernym – 3, its
hypernym – 4, and so on. Words not found in the
Thesaurus or in WordNet get specificity 1.

We seek a function that, given s, assigns to
all concepts of specificity s a weight progressively
larger than to their neighbours. The weights in this
function should be assigned based on specificity, so
that all concepts of the same specificity receive the
same score. Weights will differ depending on a com-
bination of specificity and how frequently words that
signal the concepts appear in a sentence. The weight
of concepts with specificity s should be the highest,
of those with specificity s± 1 – lower, of those with
specificity s ± 2 lower still, and so on. In order to
achieve this effect, we weight the concepts using a
normal distribution, where the mean is s:

f(x) =
1

σ
√

2π
e

„
− (x−s)

2

2σ2

«

Since the Head is often considered the main cat-
egory in Roget’s, we expect a specificity of 5 to be
best, but we decided to test the values 1 through 9
as a possible setting for specificity. We do not claim
that this weighting scheme is optimal; other weight-
ing schemes might do better. For the purpose of

comparing the 1911 and 1987 Thesauri and Word-
Net, however, this method appears sufficient.

With this weighting scheme, we determine the
distance between two sentences using cosine simi-
larity:

cosSim(A,B) =
∑
ai ∗ bi√∑

a2i ∗
√∑

b2i

For this problem we used the MIT Java WordNet In-
terface version 1.1.17.

3.3.3 Sentence similarity results
We used this method of representation for Roget’s

of 1911 and of 1987, as well as for WordNet 3.0 –
see Figure 1. For comparison, we also implemented
a baseline method that we refer to as Simple: we
built vectors out of words and their count.

It can be seen in Figure 1 that each system is su-
perior for at least one of the nine specificities. The
Simple method is best at a specificity of 1, 8 and 9,
Roget’s Thesaurus 1911 is best at 6, Roget’s The-
saurus 1987 is best at 4, 5 and 7, and WordNet is
best at 2 and 3. The systems based on Roget’s and
WordNet more or less followed a bell-shaped curve,
with the curves of the 1911 and 1987 Thesauri fol-
lowing each other fairly closely and peaking close
together. WordNet clearly peaked first and then fell
the farthest.

The best correlation result for the 1987 Roget’s
Thesaurus is 0.8725 when the mean is 4, the POS.
The maximum correlation for the 1911 Thesaurus is
0.8367, where the mean is 5, the Head. The max-
imum for WordNet is 0.8506, where the mean is 3,
or the first hypernym synset. This suggests that the
POS and Head are most important for representing
text in Roget’s Thesaurus, while the first hypernym
is most important for representing text using Word-
Net. For the Simple method, we found a more mod-
est correlation of 0.6969.

Figure 1: Correlation data for all four systems.

Several other methods have given very good
scores on this data set. For the system in (Li et
al., 2006), where this data set was first introduced, a
correlation of 0.816 with the human annotators was
achieved. The mean of all human annotators had a
score of 0.825, with a standard deviation of 0.072.
In (Islam and Inkpen, 2007), an even better system
was proposed, with a correlation of 0.853.

Selecting the mean that gives the best correlation
could be considered as training on test data. How-
ever, were we simply to have selected a value some-
where in the middle of the graph, as was our original
intuition, it would have given an unfair advantage
to either version of Roget’s Thesaurus over Word-
Net. Our system shows good results for both ver-
sions of Roget’s Thesauri and WordNet. The 1987
Thesaurus once again performs better than the 1911
version and than WordNet. Much like (Miller and
Charles, 1991), the data set used here is not large
enough to determine if any system’s improvement is
statistically significant.

4 Conclusion and future work

The 1987 version of Roget’s Thesaurus performed
better than the 1911 version on all our tests, but we
did not find the differences to be statistically signifi-
cant. It is particularly interesting that the 1911 The-
saurus performed as well as it did, given that it is al-
most 100 years old. On problems such as semantic
word relatedness, the 1911 Thesaurus performance
was fairly close to that of the 1987 Thesaurus, and
was comparable to many WordNet-based measures.
For problems of identifying synonyms both versions
of Roget’s Thesaurus performed relatively well com-
pared to most WordNet-based methods.

We have presented a new method of sentence
representation that attempts to leverage the struc-
ture found in Roget’s Thesaurus and similar lexi-
cal ontologies (among them WordNet). We have
shown that given this style of text representation
both versions of Roget’s Thesaurus work compara-
bly to WordNet. All three perform fairly well com-
pared to the baseline Simple method. Once again,
the 1987 version is superior to the 1911 version, but
the 1911 version still works quite well.

We hope to investigate further the representation
of sentences and other short texts using Roget’s
Thesaurus. These kinds of measurements can help
with problems such as identifying relevant sentences
for extractive text summarization, or possibly para-
phrase identification (Dolan et al., 2004). Another
– longer-term – direction of future work could be
merging Roget’s Thesaurus with WordNet.

We also plan to study methods of automatically
updating the 1911 Roget’s Thesaurus with modern
words. Some work has been done on adding new
terms and relations to WordNet (Snow et al., 2006)
and FACTOTUM (O’Hara and Wiebe, 2003). Sim-
ilar methods could be used for identifying related
terms and assigning them to a correct semicolon
group or paragraph.
