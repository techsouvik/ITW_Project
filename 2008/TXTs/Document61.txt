Abstract

People rarely articulate explicitly what a na-
tive speaker of a language is already assumed
to know. So to acquire the stereotypical
knowledge that underpins much of what is
said in a given culture, one must look to what
is implied by language rather than what is
overtly stated. Similes are a convenient ve-
hicle for this kind of knowledge, insofar as
they mark out the most salient aspects of the
most frequently evoked concepts. In this pa-
per we perform a multilingual exploration of
the space of common-place similes, by min-
ing a large body of Chinese similes from the
web and comparing these to the English sim-
iles harvested by Veale and Hao (2007). We
demonstrate that while the simile-frame is in-
herently leaky in both languages, a multilin-
gual analysis allows us to filter much of the
noise that otherwise hinders the knowledge
extraction process. In doing so, we can also
identify a core set of stereotypical descrip-
tions that exist in both languages and accu-
rately map these descriptions onto a multilin-
gual lexical ontology like HowNet. Finally,
we demonstrate that conceptual descriptions
that are derived from common-place similes
are extremely compact and predictive of onto-
logical structure.

1 Introduction

Direct perception of our environment is just one
of the ways we can acquire knowledge of the
world. Another, more distinctly human approach,
is through the comprehension of linguistic descrip-
tions of another person’s perceptions and beliefs.

Since computers have limited means of human-like
perception, the latter approach is also very much
suited to the automatic acquisition of world knowl-
edge by a computer (see Hearst, 1992; Charniak and
Berland, 1999; Etzioni et al., 2004; Völker et al.,
2005; Almuhareb and Poesio, 2005; Cimiano and
Wenderoth, 2007; Veale and Hao, 2007). Thus, by
using the web as a distributed text corpus (see Keller
et al., 2002), a multitude of facts and beliefs can
be extracted, for purposes ranging from question-
answering to ontology population.

The possible configurations of different concepts
can also be learned from how the words denoting
these concepts are distributed; thus, a computer can
learn that coffee is a beverage that can be served hot
or cold, white or black, strong or weak and sweet
or bitter (see Almuhareb and Poesio, 2005). But it
is difficult to discern from these facts the idealized
or stereotypical states of the world, e.g., that one ex-
pects coffee to be hot and beer to be cold, so that if
one spills coffee, we naturally infer the possibilities
of scalding and staining without having to be told
that the coffee was hot or black; the assumptions
of hotness and blackness are just two stereotypical
facts about coffee that we readily take for granted.
Lenat and Guha (1990) describe these assumed facts
as residing in the white space of a text, in the body
of common-sense assumptions that are rarely articu-
lated as explicit statements. These culturally-shared
common-sense beliefs cannot be harvested directly
from a single web resource or document set, but
must be gleaned indirectly, from telling phrases that
are scattered across the many texts of the web.

Veale and Hao (2007) argue that the most pivotal

523



reference points of this world-view can be detected
in common-place similes like “as lazy as a dog”, “as
fat as a hippo” or “as chaste as a nun”. To the extent
that this world-view is ingrained in and influenced
by how we speak, it can differ from culture to cul-
ture and language to language. In English texts, for
example, the concept Tortoise is stereotypically as-
sociated with the properties slowness, patience and
wrinkled, but in Chinese texts, we find that the same
animal is a model of slowness, ugliness, and nutri-
tional value. Likewise, because Chinese “wine” has
a high alcohol content, the dimension of Strength is
much more salient to a Chinese speaker than an En-
glish speaker, as reflected in how the word酒 is used
in statements such as像酒一样浓重, which means
“as strong as wine”, or literally, “as wine equally
strong”.

In this paper, we compare the same web-based
approach to acquiring stereotypical concept descrip-
tions from text using two very different languages,
English and Chinese, to determine the extent to
which the same cross-cultural knowledge is un-
earthed for each. In other words, we treat the web as
a large parallel corpus (e.g., see Resnick and Smith,
2003), though not of parallel documents in dif-
ferent languages, but of corresponding translation-
equivalent phrases. By seeking translation equiva-
lence between different pieces of textually-derived
knowledge, this paper addresses the following ques-
tions: if a particular syntagmatic pattern is useful for
mining knowledge in English, can its translated form
be equally useful for Chinese? To what extent does
the knowledge acquired using different source lan-
guages overlap, and to what extent is this knowledge
language- (and culture-) specific? Given that the
syntagmatic patterns used in each language are not
wholly unambiguous or immune to noise, to what
extent should finding the same beliefs expressed in
two different languages increase our confidence in
the acquired knowledge? Finally, what representa-
tional synergies arise from finding these same facts
expressed in two different languages?

Given these goals, the rest of the paper as-
sumes the following structure: in section 2, we
summarize related work on syntagmatic approaches
to knowledge-acquisition; in section 3, we de-
scribe our multilingual efforts in English and Chi-
nese to acquire stereotypical or generic-level facts

from the web, by using corresponding translations
of the commonplace stereotype-establishing pattern
“as ADJ as a NOUN”; and in section 4, we describe
how these English and Chinese data-sets can be uni-
fied using the bilingual ontology HowNet (Dong and
Dong, 2006). This mapping allows us to determine
the meaning overlap in both data sets, the amount
of noise in each data set, and the degree to which
this noise is reduced when parallel translations can
be identified. In section 5 we demonstrate the
overall usefulness of stereotype-based knowledge-
representation by replicating the clustering experi-
ments of Almuhareb and Poesio (2004, 2005) and
showing that stereotype-based representations are
both compact and predictive of ontological classi-
fication. We conclude the paper with some final re-
marks in section 6.

2 Related Work

Text-based approaches to knowledge acquisition
range from the ambitiously comprehensive, in which
an entire text or resource is fully parsed and ana-
lyzed in depth, to the surgically precise, in which
highly-specific text patterns are used to eke out cor-
respondingly specific relationships from a large cor-
pus. Endeavors such as that of Harabagiu et al.
(1999), in which each of the textual glosses in Word-
Net (Fellbaum, 1998) is linguistically analyzed to
yield a sense-tagged logical form, is an example of
the former approach. In contrast, foundational ef-
forts such as that of Hearst (1992) typify the latter
surgical approach, in which one fishes in a large text
for word sequences that strongly suggest a particu-
lar semantic relationship, such as hypernymy or, in
the case of Charniak and Berland (1999), the part-
whole relation. Such efforts offer high precision but
low recall, and extract just a tiny (but very useful)
subset of the semantic content of a text. The Know-
ItAll system of Etzioni et al. (2004) employs the
same generic patterns as Hearst ( e.g., “NPs such
as NP1, NP2, ...”), and more besides, to extract a
whole range of facts that can be exploited for web-
based question-answering. Cimiano and Wenderoth
(2007) also use a range of Hearst-like patterns to
find text sequences in web-text that are indicative
of the lexico-semantic properties of words; in par-
ticular, these authors use phrases like “to * a new

524



NOUN” and “the purpose of NOUN is to *” to
identify the agentive and telic roles of given nouns,
thereby fleshing out the noun’s qualia structure as
posited by Pustejovsky’s (1990) theory of the gener-
ative lexicon.

The basic Hearst approach has even proven use-
ful for identifying the meta-properties of concepts
in a formal ontology. Völker et al. (2005) show
that patterns like “is no longer a|an NOUN” can
identify, with reasonable accuracy, those concepts
in an ontology that are not rigid, which is to say,
concepts like Teacher and Student whose instances
may at any point stop being instances of these con-
cepts. Almuhareb and Poesio (2005) use patterns
like “a|an|the * C is|was” and “the * of the C is|was”
to find the actual properties of concepts as they are
used in web texts; the former pattern is used to iden-
tify value features like hot, red, large, etc., while
the latter is used to identify the attribute features
that correspond to these values, such as tempera-
ture, color and size. Almuhareb and Poesio go on
to demonstrate that the values and attributes that are
found for word-concepts on the web yield a suffi-
ciently rich representation for these word-concepts
to be automatically clustered into a form resembling
that assigned by WordNet (see Fellbaum, 1998).
Veale and Hao (2007) show that the pattern “as ADJ
as a|an NOUN” can also be used to identify the
value feature associated with a given concept, and
argue that because this pattern corresponds to that
of the simile frame in English, the adjectival fea-
tures that are retrieved are much more likely to be
highly salient of the noun-concept (the simile ve-
hicle) that is used. Whereas Almuhareb and Poe-
sio succeed in identifying the range of potential at-
tributes and values that may be possessed by a par-
ticular concept, Veale and Hao succeed in identi-
fying the generic properties of a concept as it is
conceived in its stereotypical form. As noted by
the latter authors, this results in a much smaller yet
more diagnostic feature set for each concept. How-
ever, because the simile frame is often exploited for
ironic purposes in web texts (e.g., “as meaty as a
skeleton”), and because irony is so hard to detect,
Veale and Hao suggest that the adjective:noun pair-
ings found on the web should be hand-filtered to re-
move such examples. Given this onerous require-
ment for hand-filtering, and the unique, culturally-

loaded nature of the noise involved, we use the work
of Veale and Hao as the basis for the cross-cultural
investigation in this paper.

3 Harvesting Knowledge from Similes:
English and Chinese

Because similes are containers of culturally-
received knowledge, we can reasonably expect the
most commonly used similes to vary significantly
from language to language, especially when those
languages correspond to very different cultures.
These similes form part of the linguistic currency of
a culture which must be learned by a speaker, and
indeed, some remain opaque even to the most edu-
cated native speakers. In “A Christmas Carol”, for
instance, Dickens (1943/1984) questions the mean-
ing of “as dead as a doornail”, and notes: “I might
have been inclined, myself, to regard a coffin-nail as
the deadest piece of ironmongery in the trade. But
the wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile”.

Notwithstanding the opacity of some instances of
the simile form, similes are very revealing about the
concepts one most encounters in everyday language.
In section 5 we demonstrate that concept descrip-
tions which are harvested from similes are both ex-
tremely compact and highly predictive of ontolog-
ical structure. For now, we turn to the process by
which similes can be harvested from the text of the
web. In section 3.1 we summarize the efforts of
Veale and Hao, whose database of English similes
drives part of our current investigation. In section
3.2 we describe how a comparable database of Chi-
nese similes can be harvested from the web.

3.1 Harvesting English Similes

Veale and Hao (2007) use the Google API in con-
junction with Princeton WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998)
as the basis of their harvesting system. They first
extracted a list of antonymous adjectives, such as
“hot” or “cold”, from WordNet, the intuition being
that explicit similes will tend to exploit properties
that occupy an exemplary point on a scale. For ev-
ery adjective ADJ on this list, they then sent the
query “as ADJ as *” to Google and scanned the
first 200 snippets returned for different noun val-
ues for the wildcard *. The complete set of nouns
extracted in this way was then used to drive a sec-

525



ond harvesting phase, in which the query “as * as
a NOUN” was used to collect similes that employ
different adjectives or which lie beyond the 200-
snippet horizon of the original search. Based on
this wide-ranging series of core samples (of 200 hits
each) from across the web, Veale and Hao report
that both phases together yielded 74,704 simile in-
stances (of 42,618 unique types, or unique adjec-
tive:noun pairings), relating 3769 different adjec-
tives to 9286 different nouns. As often noted by
other authors, such as Völker et al. (2005), a pattern-
oriented approach to knowledge mining is prone to
noise, not least because the patterns used are rarely
leak-free (inasmuch as they admit word sequences
that do not exhibit the desired relationship), and be-
cause these patterns look at small text sequences in
isolation from their narrative contexts. Veale and
Hao (2007) report that when the above 42,618 simile
types are hand-annotated by a native speaker, only
12,259 were judged as non-ironic and meaningful
in a null context. In other words, just 29% of the
retrieved pairings conform to what one would con-
sider a well-formed and reusable simile that conveys
some generic aspect of cultural knowledge. Of those
deemed invalid, 2798 unique pairings were tagged
as ironic, insofar as they stated precisely the oppo-
site of what is stereotypically believed to be true.

3.2 Harvesting Chinese Similes

To harvest a comparable body of Chinese similes
from the web, we also use the Google API, in con-
junction with both WordNet and HowNet (Dong and
Dong, 2006). HowNet is a bilingual lexical ontol-
ogy that associates English and Chinese word labels
with an underlying set of approximately 100,000
lexical concepts. While each lexical concept is de-
fined using a unique numeric identifier, almost all of
HowNet’s concepts can be uniquely identified by a
pairing of English and Chinese labels. For instance,
the word “王八” can mean both Tortoise and Cuck-
old in Chinese, but the combined label tortoise|王八
uniquely picks out the first sense while cuckold|王
八 uniquely picks out the second. Though Chi-
nese has a large number of figurative expressions,
the yoking of English to Chinese labels still serves
to identify the correct sense in almost every case.
For instance, “绿帽子” is another word for Cuck-
old in Chinese, but it can also translate as “green

hat” and “green scarf”. Nonetheless, green hat|绿
帽子 uniquely identifies the literal sense of “绿帽
子” (a green covering) while green scarf|绿帽子
and cuckold|绿帽子 both identify the same human
sense, the former being a distinctly culture-specific
metaphor for cuckolded males (in English, a dispos-
sessed lover “wears the cuckold’s horns”; in Chi-
nese, one apparently “wears a green scarf”).

We employ the same two-phase design as Veale
and Hao: an initial set of Chinese adjectives are
extracted from HowNet, with the stipulation that
their English translations (as given by HowNet) are
also categorized as adjectives in WordNet. We
then use the Chinese equivalent of the English sim-
ile frame “像* 一样ADJ” (literally, “as-NOUN-
equally-ADJ”) to retrieve a set of noun values that
stereotypically embody these adjectival features.
Again, a set of 200 snippets is analyzed for each
query, and only those values of the Google * wild-
card that HowNet categorizes as nouns are accepted.
In a second phase, these nouns are used to create
new queries of the form “像Noun一样*” and the re-
sulting Google snippets are now scanned for adjec-
tival values of *.

In all, 25,585 unique Chinese similes (i.e., pair-
ings of an adjective to a noun) are harvested, link-
ing 3080 different Chinese adjectives to 4162 Chi-
nese nouns. When hand-annotated by a native Chi-
nese speaker, the Chinese simile frame reveals it-
self to be considerably less leaky than the corre-
sponding English frame. Over 58% of these pairings
(14,867) are tagged as well-formed and meaning-
ful similes that convey some stereotypical element
of world knowledge. The Chinese pattern “像*一
样*” is thus almost twice as reliable as the English
”as * as a *” pattern. In addition, Chinese speak-
ers exploit the simile frame much less frequently for
ironic purposes, since just 185 of the retrieved sim-
iles (or 0.7%) are tagged as ironic, compared with
ten times as many (or 7%) retrieved English similes.
In the next section we consider the extent to which
these English and Chinese similes convey the same
information.

4 Tagging and Mapping of Similes

In each case, the harvesting processes for English
and for Chinese allow us to acquire stereotypi-

526



cal associations between words, not word senses.
Nonetheless, the frequent use of synonymous terms
introduces a substantial degree of redundancy in
these associations, and this redundancy can be used
to perform sense discrimination. In the case of En-
glish similes, Veale and Hao (2007) describe how
two English similes “as A as N1” and “as A as
N2” will be mutually disambiguating if N1 and
N2 are synonyms in WordNet, or if some sense
of N1 is a hypernym or hyponym of some sense
of N2 in WordNet. This heuristic allows Veale
and Hao to automatically sense-tag 85%, or 10,378,
of the unique similes that are annotated as valid.
We apply a similar intuition to the disambiguation
of Chinese similes: though HowNet does not sup-
port the notion of a synset, different word-senses
that have the same meaning will be associated with
the same logical definition. Thus, the Chinese
word “著名” can translate as “celebrated”, “fa-
mous”, “well-known” and “reputable”, but all four
of these possible senses, given by celebrated|著名,
famous|著名, well-known|著名 and reputable|著
名, are associated with the same logical form in
HowNet, which defines them as a specialization of
ReputationValue|名声值. This allows us to safely
identify “著名” with this logical form. Overall, 69%
of Chinese similes can have both their adjective and
noun assigned to specific HowNet meanings in this
way.

4.1 Translation Equivalence Among Similes

Since HowNet represents an integration of English
and Chinese lexicons, it can easily be used to con-
nect the English and Chinese data-sets. For while
the words used in any given simile are likely to
be ambiguous (in the case of one-character Chinese
words, highly so), it would seem unlikely that an
incorrect translation of a web simile would also be
found on the web. This is an intuition that we can
now use the annotated data-sets to evaluate.

For every English simile of the form <Ae as
Ne>, we use HowNet to generate a range of possible
Chinese variations <Ac0 as Nc0>, <Ac1 as Nc0>,
<Ac0 as Nc1>, <Ac1 as Nc1>, ... by using the
HowNet lexical entries Ae|Ac0, Ae|Ac1, ..., Ne|Nc0,
Ne|Nc1, ... as a translation bridge. If the variation
<Aci as Ncj> is found in the Chinese data-set, then
translation equivalence is assumed between <Ae as

Chinese 0.82 0.27 0.41

Equivalence.

Ne> and <Aci as Ncj>; furthermore, Ae|Aci is as-
sumed to be the HowNet sense of the adjectives Ae
and Aci while Ncj is assumed to be the HowNet
sense of the nouns Ne and Ncj . Sense-tagging is
thus a useful side-effect of simile-mapping with a
bilingual lexicon.

We attempt to find Chinese translation equiva-
lences for all 42,618 of the English adjective:noun
pairings harvested by Veale and Hao; this includes
both the 12,259 pairings that were hand-annotated as
valid stereotypical facts, and the remaining 30,359
that were dismissed as noisy or ironic. Using
HowNet, we can establish equivalences from 4177
English similes to 4867 Chinese similes. In those
mapped, we find 3194 English similes and 4019
Chinese similes that were hand-annotated as valid
by their respective native-speaker judges. In other
words, translation equivalence can be used to sep-
arate well-formed stereotypical beliefs from ill-
formed or ironic beliefs with approximately 80%
precision. The precise situation is summarized in
Table 1.

As noted in section 3, just 29% of raw English
similes and 58% of raw Chinese similes that are har-
vested from web-text are judged as valid stereotyp-
ical statements by a native-speaking judge. For the
task of filtering irony and noise from raw data sets,
translation equivalence thus offers good precision
but poor recall, since most English similes appear
not to have a corresponding Chinese variant on the
web. Nonetheless, this heuristic allows us to reliably
identify a sizeable body of cross-cultural stereotypes
that hold in both languages.

4.1.1 Error Analysis
Noisy propositions may add little but empty con-

tent to a representation, but ironic propositions will
actively undermine a representation from within,
leading to inferences that are not just unlikely, but
patently false (as is generally the intention of irony).
Since Veale and Hao (2007) annotate their data-

527



set for irony, this allows us to measure the number
of egregious mistakes made when using translation
equivalence as a simile filter. Overall, we see that
1% of Chinese similes that are accepted via transla-
tion equivalence are ironic, accounting for 9% of all
errors made when filtering Chinese similes. Like-
wise, 1% of the English similes that are accepted are
ironic, accounting for 5% of all errors made when
filtering English similes.

4.2 Representational Synergies

By mapping WordNet-tagged English similes onto
HowNet-tagged Chinese similes, we effectively ob-
tain two representational viewpoints onto the same
shared data set. For instance, though HowNet
has a much shallower hierarchical organization
than WordNet, it compensates by encapsulating the
meaning of different word senses using simple log-
ical formulae of semantic primitives, or sememes,
that are derived from the meaning of common Chi-
nese characters. WordNet and HowNet thus offer
two complementary levels or granularities of gen-
eralization that can be exploited as the context de-
mands.

4.2.1 Adjective Organization
Unlike WordNet, HowNet organizes its adjec-

tival senses hierarchically, allowing one to obtain
a weaker form of a given description by climb-
ing the hierarchy, or to obtain a stronger form by
descending the hierarchy from a particular sense.
Thus, one can go up from kaleidoscopic|斑驳陆
离 to colored|彩, or down from colored|彩 to
any of motley|斑驳, dappled|斑驳, prismatic|斑驳
陆离 and even gorgeous|斑斓. Once stereotypi-
cal descriptions have been sense-tagged relative to
HowNet, they can easily be further enhanced or
bleached to suit the context of their use. For exam-
ple, by allowing a Chinese adjective to denote any
of the senses above it or below in the HowNet hi-
erarchy, we can extend the mapping of English to
Chinese similes so as to achieve an improved recall
of .36 (though we note that this technique reduces
the precision of the translation-equivalence heuristic
to .75).

As demonstrated by Almuhareb and Poesio
(2004), the best conceptual descriptions combine
adjectival values with the attributes that they fill.

Because adjectival senses hook into HowNet’s up-
per ontology via a series of abstract taxonyms like
TasteValue|美丑值, ReputationValue|名声值 and
AmountValue|多少值, a taxonym of the form At-
tributeValue can be identified for every adjective
sense in HowNet. For example, the English ad-
jective ”beautiful” can denote either beautiful|美,
organized by HowNet under BeautyValue|美丑
值, or beautiful|婉, organized by HowNet un-
der gracious|雅 which in turn is organized under
GraceValue|典雅值. The adjective “beautiful” can
therefore specify either the Grace or Beauty at-
tributes of a concept. Once similes have been sense-
tagged, we can build up a picture of most salient at-
tributes of our stereotypical concepts. For instance,
“peacock” similes yield the following attributes via
HowNet: Beauty, Appearance, Color, Pride, Be-
havior, Resplendence, Bearing and Grace; likewise
“demon” similes yield the following: Morality, Be-
havior, Temperament, Ability and Competence.

4.2.2 Orthographic Form
The Chinese data-set lacks counterparts to many

similes that one would not think of as culturally-
determined, such “as red as a ruby”, “as cruel as
a tyrant” and “as smelly as a skunk”. One signifi-
cant reason for this kind of omission is not cultural
difference, but obviousness: many Chinese words
are multi-character gestalts of different ideas (see
Packard, 2000), so that these ideas form an explicit
part of the orthography of a lexical concept. For in-
stance, using HowNet, we can see that skunk|臭鼬
is actually a gestalt of the concepts smelly|臭 and
weasel|鼬, so the simile “as smelly as a skunk” is
already somewhat redundant in Chinese (somewhat
akin to the English similes “as hot as a hotdog” or
“as hard as a hardhat”).

Such decomposition can allow us to find those
English similes that are already orthographically ex-
plicit in Chinese word-forms. We simply look for
pairs of HowNet senses of the form Noun|XYZ and
Adj|X, where X and XYZ are Chinese words and the
simile “as Adj as a|an Noun” is found in the English
simile set. When we do so, we find that 648 English
similes, from “as meaty as a steak” to “as resonant
as a cello”, are already fossilized in the orthographic
realization of the corresponding Chinese concepts.
When fossilized similes are uncovered in this way,

528



the recall of translation equivalence as a noise filter
rises to .29, while its precision rises to .84 (see Table
1)

5 Empirical Evaluation: Simile-derived
Representations

Stereotypes persist in language and culture because
they are, more often than not, cognitively useful:
by emphasizing the most salient aspects of a con-
cept, a stereotype acts as a dense conceptual descrip-
tion that is easily communicated, widely shared,
and which supports rapid inference. To demonstrate
the usefulness of stereotype-based concept descrip-
tions, we replicate here the clustering experiments
of Almuhareb and Poesio (2004, 2005), who in turn
demonstrated that conceptual features that are mined
from specific textual patterns can be used to con-
struct WordNet-like ontological structures. These
authors used different text patterns for mining fea-
ture values (like hot) and attributes (like tempera-
ture), and their experiments evaluated the relative ef-
fectiveness of each as a means of ontological cluster-
ing. Since our focus in this paper is on the harvesting
of feature values, we replicate here only their exper-
iments with values.

Almuhareb and Poesio (2004) used as their ex-
perimental basis a sampling of 214 English nouns
from 13 of WordNet’s upper-level semantic cate-
gories, and proceeded to harvest adjectival features
for these noun-concepts from the web using the tex-
tual pattern “[a | an | the] * C [is |was]”. This pattern
yielded a combined total of 51,045 value features
for these 214 nouns, such as hot, black, etc., which
were then used as the basis of a clustering algorithm
in an attempt to reconstruct the WordNet classifica-
tions for all 214 nouns. Clustering was performed
by the CLUTO-2.1 package (Karypis, 2003), which
partitioned the 214 nouns in 13 categories on the ba-
sis of their 51,045 web-derived features. Compar-
ing these clusters with the original WordNet-based
groupings, Almuhareb and Poesio report a cluster-
ing accuracy of 71.96%. In a second, larger exper-
iment, Almuhareb and Poesio (2005) sampled 402
nouns from 21 different semantic classes in Word-
Net, and harvested 94,989 feature values from the
web using the same textual pattern. They then ap-
plied the repeated bisections clustering algorithm to

mance, these authors then proceed to apply a variety
of noise filters to reduce the set of feature values to
51,345, which in turn leads to an improved cluster
purity measure of 62.7%.

We replicated both of Almuhareb and Poesio’s
experiments on the same experimental data-sets (of
214 and 402 nouns respectively), using instead the
English simile pattern “as * as a NOUN” to harvest
features for these nouns from the web. Note that
in keeping with the original experiments, no hand-
tagging or filtering of these features is performed, so
that every raw match with the simile pattern is used.
Overall, we harvest just 2209 feature values for the
214 nouns of experiment 1, and 5547 features for the
402 nouns of experiment 2. A comparison of both
sets of results for experiment 1 is shown is Table 2,
while a comparison based on experiment 2 is shown
is Table 3.

While Almuhareb and Poesio achieve marginally
higher clustering on the 214 nouns of experiment 1,
they do so by using over 20 times as many features.

In experiment 2, we see a similar ratio of feature
quantities before filtering; after some initial filtering,
Almuhareb and Poesio reduce their feature set to just
under 10 times the size of the simile-derived feature
set.

These experiments demonstrate two key points
about stereotype-based representations. First, the
feature representations do not need to be hand-
filtered and noise-free to be effective; we see from
the above results that the raw values extracted
from the simile pattern prove slightly more effec-
tive than filtered feature sets used by Almuhareb and
Poesio. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly,
stereotype-based representations prove themselves a
much more compact means (by factor of 10 to 20
times) of achieving the same clustering goals.

6 Conclusions

Knowledge-acquisition from texts can be a process
fraught with complexity: such texts - especially
web-based texts - are frequently under-determined
and vague; highly ambiguous, both lexically and
structurally; and dense with figures of speech, hy-
perbolae and irony. None of the syntagmatic frames
surveyed in section 2, from the “NP such as NP1,
NP2 ...” pattern of Hearst (1992) and Etzioni et al.
(2004) to the “no longer NOUN” pattern of Völker
et al. (2005), are leak-free and immune to noise.
Cimiano and Wenderoth (2007) mitigate this prob-
lem somewhat by performing part-of-speech anal-
ysis on all extracted text sequences, but the prob-
lem remains: the surgical, pattern-based approach
offers an efficient and targeted means of knowledge-
acquisition from corpora because it largely ignores
the context in which these patterns occur; yet one
requires this context to determine if a given text se-
quence really is a good exemplar of the semantic re-
lationship that is sought.

In this paper we have described how stereotyp-
ical associations between adjectival properties and
noun concepts can be mined from similes in web
text. When harvested in both English and Chi-
nese, these associations exhibit two kinds of re-
dundancy that can mitigate the problem of noise.
The first kind, within-language redundancy, allows
us to perform sense-tagging of the adjectives and
nouns that are used in similes, by exploiting the

fact that the same stereotypical association can oc-
cur in a variety of synonymous forms. By recog-
nizing synonymy between the elements of different
similes, we can thus identify the underlying senses
(or WordNet synsets) in these similes. The sec-
ond kind, between-language redundancy, exploits
the fact that the same associations can occur in dif-
ferent languages, allowing us to exploit translation-
equivalence to pin these associations to particular
lexical concepts in a multilingual lexical ontology
like HowNet. While between-language redundancy
is a limited phenomenon, with just 26% of Veale
and Hao’s annotated English similes having Chinese
translations on the web, this phenomenon does allow
us to identify a significant core of shared stereotyp-
ical knowledge across these two very different lan-
guages.

Overall, our analysis suggests that a comparable
number of well-formed Chinese and English similes
can be mined from the web (our exploration finds
approx. 12,000 unique examples of each). This
demonstrates that harvesting stereotypical knowl-
edge from similes is a workable strategy in both lan-
guages. Moreover, Chinese simile usage is charac-
terized by two interesting facts that are of some prac-
tical import: the simile frame “像NOUN一样ADJ”
is a good deal less leaky and prone to noise than the
equivalent English frame, “as ADJ as a NOUN”; and
Chinese speakers appear less willing to subvert the
stereotypical norms of similes for ironic purposes.
Further research is needed to determine whether
these observations generalize to other knowledge-
mining patterns.
