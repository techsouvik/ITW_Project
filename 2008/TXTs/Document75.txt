Abstract

Entropy Guided Transformation Learning
(ETL) is a new machine learning strategy
that combines the advantages of decision
trees (DT) and Transformation Based Learn-
ing (TBL). In this work, we apply the ETL
framework to four phrase chunking tasks: Por-
tuguese noun phrase chunking, English base
noun phrase chunking, English text chunking
and Hindi text chunking. In all four tasks,
ETL shows better results than Decision Trees
and also than TBL with hand-crafted tem-
plates. ETL provides a new training strat-
egy that accelerates transformation learning.
For the English text chunking task this corre-
sponds to a factor of five speedup. For Por-
tuguese noun phrase chunking, ETL shows the
best reported results for the task. For the other
three linguistic tasks, ETL shows state-of-the-
art competitive results and maintains the ad-
vantages of using a rule based system.

1 Introduction

Phrase Chunking is a Natural Language Processing
(NLP) task that consists in dividing a text into syn-
tactically correlated parts of words. Theses phrases
are non-overlapping, i.e., a word can only be a mem-
ber of one chunk (Sang and Buchholz, 2000). It pro-
vides a key feature that helps on more elaborated
NLP tasks such as parsing and information extrac-
tion.

Since the last decade, many high-performance
chunking systems were proposed, such as, SVM-
based (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001; Wu et al.,

2006), Winnow (Zhang et al., 2002), voted-
perceptrons (Carreras and Màrquez, 2003),
Transformation-Based Learning (TBL) (Ramshaw
and Marcus, 1999; Megyesi, 2002) and Hidden
Markov Model (HMM) (Molina and Pla, 2002),
Memory-based (Sang, 2002). State-of-the-art
systems for English base noun phrase chunking and
text chunking are based in statistical techniques
(Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001; Wu et al., 2006;
Zhang et al., 2002).

TBL is one of the most accurate rule-based tech-
niques for phrase chunking tasks (Ramshaw and
Marcus, 1999; Ngai and Florian, 2001; Megyesi,
2002). On the other hand, TBL rules must follow
patterns, called templates, that are meant to cap-
ture the relevant feature combinations. The process
of generating good templates is highly expensive.
It strongly depends on the problem expert skills to
build them. Even when a template set is available
for a given task, it may not be effective when we
change from a language to another (dos Santos and
Oliveira, 2005).

In this work, we apply Entropy Guided Transfor-
mation Learning (ETL) for phrase chunking. ETL is
a new machine learning strategy that combines the
advantages of Decision Trees (DT) and TBL (dos
Santos and Milidiú, 2007a). The ETL key idea is to
use decision tree induction to obtain feature com-
binations (templates) and then use the TBL algo-
rithm to generate transformation rules. ETL pro-
duces transformation rules that are more effective
than decision trees and also eliminates the need of
a problem domain expert to build TBL templates.

We evaluate the performance of ETL over four

647



phrase chunking tasks: (1) English Base Noun
Phrase (NP) chunking; (2) Portuguese NP chunk-
ing; (3) English Text Chunking; and (4) Hindi Text
Chunking. Base NP chunking consists in recogniz-
ing non-overlapping text segments that contain NPs.
Text chunking consists in dividing a text into syn-
tactically correlated parts of words. For these four
tasks, ETL shows state-of-the-art competitive results
and maintains the advantages of using a rule based
system.

The remainder of the paper is organized as fol-
lows. In section 2, the ETL strategy is described.
In section 3, the experimental design and the corre-
sponding results are reported. Finally, in section 4,
we present our concluding remarks.

2 Entropy Guided Transformation
Learning

Entropy Guided Transformation Learning (ETL)
is a new machine learning strategy that com-
bines the advantages of Decision Trees (DT) and
Transformation-Based Learning (TBL) (dos Santos
and Milidiú, 2007a). The key idea of ETL is to use
decision tree induction to obtain templates. Next,
the TBL strategy is used to generate transformation
rules. The proposed method is illustrated in the Fig.
1.

Figure 1: ETL - Entropy Guided Transformation Learn-
ing.

A combination of DT and TBL is presented in
(Corston-Oliver and Gamon, 2003). The main dif-
ference between Corston-Oliver & Gamon work and
the ETL strategy is that they extract candidate rules
directly from the DT, and then use the TBL strategy

to select the appropriate rules. Another difference is
that they use a binary DT, whereas ETL uses a DT
that is not necessarily binary.

An evolutionary approach based on Genetic Al-
gorithms (GA) to automatically generate TBL tem-
plates is presented in (Milidiú et al., 2007). Us-
ing a simple genetic coding, the generated template
sets have efficacy near to the handcrafted templates
for the tasks: English Base Noun Phrase Identifica-
tion, Text Chunking and Portuguese Named Entities
Recognition. The main drawback of this strategy is
that the GA step is computationally expensive. If we
need to consider a large context window or a large
number of features, it can be infeasible.

The remainder of this section is organized as fol-
lows. In section 2.1, we describe the DT learning
algorithm. In section 2.2, the TBL algorithm is de-
picted. In section 2.3, we depict the process of ob-
taining templates from a decision tree decomposi-
tion. Finally, in section 2.4, we present a template
evolution scheme that speeds up the TBL step.

2.1 Decision Trees
Decision tree learning is one of the most widely used
machine learning algorithms. It performs a parti-
tioning of the training set using principles of Infor-
mation Theory. The learning algorithm executes a
general to specific search of a feature space. The
most informative feature is added to a tree structure
at each step of the search. Information Gain Ratio,
which is based on the data Entropy, is normally used
as the informativeness measure. The objective is to
construct a tree, using a minimal set of features, that
efficiently partitions the training set into classes of
observations. After the tree is grown, a pruning step
is carried out in order to avoid overfitting.

One of the most used algorithms for induction of
a DT is the C4.5 (Quinlan, 1993). We use Quinlan’s
C4.5 system throughout this work.

2.2 Transformation-Based Learning
Transformation Based error-driven Learning (TBL)
is a successful machine learning algorithm intro-
duced by Eric Brill (Brill, 1995). It has since been
used for several Natural Language Processing tasks,
such as part-of-speech (POS) tagging (Brill, 1995),
English text chunking (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1999;
dos Santos and Milidiú, 2007b), spelling correc-

648



tion (Mangu and Brill, 1997), Portuguese appos-
itive extraction (Freitas et al., 2006), Portuguese
named entity extraction (Milidiú et al., 2006) and
Portuguese noun-phrase chunking (dos Santos and
Oliveira, 2005), achieving state-of-the-art perfor-
mance in many of them.

TBL uses an error correcting strategy. Its main
scheme is to generate an ordered list of rules that
correct classification mistakes in the training set,
which have been produced by an initial classifier.

The requirements of the algorithm are:

• two instances of the training set, one that has
been correctly labeled, and another that re-
mains unlabeled;

• an initial classifier, the baseline system, which
classifies the unlabeled training set by trying
to apply the correct class for each sample. In
general, the baseline system is based on simple
statistics of the labeled training set; and

• a set of rule templates, which are meant to
capture the relevant feature combinations that
would determine the sample’s classification.
Concrete rules are acquired by instantiation of
this predefined set of rule templates.

• a threshold value, that is used as a stopping cri-
teria for the algorithm and is needed to avoid
overfitting to the training data.

The learning method is a mistake-driven greedy
procedure that iteratively acquires a set of transfor-
mation rules. The TBL algorithm can be depicted as
follows:

1. Starts applying the baseline system, in order to
guess an initial classification for the unlabeled
version of the training set;

2. Compares the resulting classification with the
correct one and, whenever a classification error
is found, all the rules that can correct it are gen-
erated by instantiating the templates. This tem-
plate instantiation is done by capturing some
contextual data of the sample being corrected.
Usually, a new rule will correct some errors, but
will also generate some other errors by chang-
ing correctly classified samples;

3. Computes the rules’ scores (errors repaired - er-
rors created). If there is not a rule with a score
above an arbitrary threshold, the learning pro-
cess is stopped;

4. Selects the best scoring rule, stores it in the set
of learned rules and applies it to the training
set;

5. Returns to step 2.

When classifying a new sample item, the resulting
sequence of rules is applied according to its genera-
tion order.

2.3 DT Template Extraction

There are many ways to extract feature combinations
from decision trees. In an path from the root to the
leaves, more informative features appear first . Since
we want to generate the most promising templates
only, we just combine the more informative ones.

The process we use to extract templates from a
DT includes a depth-first traversal of the DT. For
each visited node, we create a new template that
combines its parent node template with the feature
used to split the data at that node. This is a very
simple decomposition scheme. Nevertheless, it re-
sults into extremely effective templates. We also use
pruned trees in all experiments shown in section 3.

Fig. 2 shows an excerpt of a DT generated for the
English text chunking task1. Using the described
method to extract templates from the DT shown in
Fig. 2, we obtain the template set listed in the left
side of Table 1. In order to generate more feature
combinations, without largely increasing the num-
ber of templates, we extend the template set by in-
cluding templates that do not have the root node fea-
ture. The extended template set for the DT shown in
Fig. 2 is listed in the right side of the Table 1.

We have also tried some other strategies that ex-
tract a larger number of templates from a DT. How-
ever, the efficacy of the learned rules is quite similar
to the one generated by the first method. This rein-
forces the conjecture that a DT generates informa-
tive feature combinations.

1CK[0] = Chunk tag of the current word (initial classifier
result); CK[–1] = previous word Chunk tag; CK[1] = next word
Chunk tag; POS[0] = current word POS tag; WRD[0] = current
word.

2.4 Template Evolution Speedup

TBL training time is highly sensitive to the number
and complexity of the applied templates. In (Cur-
ran and Wong, 2000), it is argued that we can bet-
ter tune the training time vs. templates complex-
ity trade-off by using an evolutionary template ap-
proach. The main idea is to apply only a small num-
ber of templates that evolve throughout the training.
When training starts, templates are short, consisting
of few feature combinations. As training proceeds,
templates evolve to more complex ones that contain
more feature combinations. In this way, only a few
templates are considered at any point in time. Nev-
ertheless, the descriptive power is not significantly
reduced.

The template evolution approach can be easily im-
plemented by using template sets extracted from a
DT. We implement this idea by successively training
TBL models. Each model uses only the templates

that contain feature combinations up to a given tree
level. For instance, using the tree shown in Fig. 2,
we have the following template sets for the three first
training rounds2:

1. CK[0] CK[1];
CK[0] CK[–1]

2. CK[0] CK[1] WRD[0];
CK[0] CK[1] POS[0]

3. CK[0] CK[1] WRD[0] CK[–1]

Using the template evolution strategy, the training
time is decreased by a factor of five for the English
text chunking task. This is a remarkable reduction,
since we use an implementation of the fastTBL algo-
rithm (Ngai and Florian, 2001) that is already a very
fast TBL version. The efficacy of the rules gener-
ated by the sequential training is quite similar to the
one obtained by training with all the templates at the
same time.

3 Experiments

This section presents the experimental setup and re-
sults of the application of ETL to four phrase chunk-
ing tasks. ETL results are compared with the results
of DT and TBL using hand-crafted templates.

In the TBL step, for each one of the four chunking
tasks, the initial classifier assigns to each word the
chunk tag that was most frequently associated with
the part-of-speech of that word in the training set.

The DT learning works as a feature selector and
is not affected by irrelevant features. We have tried
several context window sizes when training the clas-
sifiers. Some of the tested window sizes would be
very hard to be explored by a domain expert using

2We ignore templates composed of only one feature test.

TBL alone. The corresponding huge number of pos-
sible templates would be very difficult to be man-
aged by a template designer.

For the four tasks, the following experimental
setup provided us our best results.

ETL in the ETL learning, we use the features word,
POS and chunk. In order to overcome the spar-
sity problem, we only use the 200 most fre-
quent words to induce the DT. In the DT learn-
ing, the chunk tag of the word is the one applied
by the initial classifier. On the other hand, the
chunk tag of neighbor words are the true ones.
We report results for ETL trained with all the
templates at the same time as well as using tem-
plate evolution.

TBL the results for the TBL approach refers to TBL
trained with the set of templates proposed in
(Ramshaw and Marcus, 1999).

DT the best result for the DT classifier is shown.
The features word, POS and chunk are used to
generate the DT classifier. The chunk tag of a
word and its neighbors are the ones guessed by
the initial classifier. Using only the 100 most
frequent words gives our best results.

In all experiments, the term WS=X subscript
means that a window of size X was used for the
given model. For instance, ETLWS=3 corresponds
to ETL trained with window of size three, that is,
the current token, the previous and the next one.

3.1 Portuguese noun phrase chunking
For this task, we use the SNR-CLIC corpus de-
scribed in (Freitas et al., 2005). This corpus is
tagged with both POS and NP tags. The NP tags
are: I, for in NP; O, for out of NP; and B for the
leftmost word of an NP beginning immediately af-
ter another NP. We divided the corpus into 3514-
sentence (83346 tokens) training set and a 878-
sentence (20798 tokens) test set.

In Table 2 we compare the results3 of ETL with
DT and TBL. We can see that ETL, even with a
small window size, produces better results than DT
and TBL. The Fβ=1 of the ETLWS=7 classifier is
1.8% higher than the one of TBL and 2.6% higher
than the one of the DT classifier.

Table 3 shows the results4 of ETL using template
evolution. As we can see, for the task of Portuguese
noun phrase chunking, the template evolution strat-
egy reduces the average training time in approxi-
mately 35%. On the other hand, there is a decrease
of the classifier efficacy in some cases.

In (dos Santos and Oliveira, 2005), a special set
of six templates is shown. These templates are
designed to reduce classification errors of prepo-
sition within the task of Portuguese noun phrase
chunking. These templates use very specific do-
main knowledge and are difficult to DT and TBL
to extract. Table 4 shows the results of an experi-
ment where we include these six templates into the
Ramshaw&Marcus template set and also into the
template sets generated by ETL. Again, ETL pro-
duces better results than TBL.

Table 5 shows the results of using a committee
composed by the three best ETL classifiers. The
classification is done by selecting the most popular
tag among all the three committee members. The
achieved Fβ=1, 89.14% is the best one ever reported
for the SNR-CLIC corpus.

3.2 English base noun phrase chunking

The data used in the base NP chunking experiments
is the one by Ramshaw & Marcus (Ramshaw and
Marcus, 1999). This corpus contains sections 15-
18 and section 20 of the Penn Treebank, and is pre-
divided into 8936-sentence (211727 tokens) training
set and a 2012-sentence (47377 tokens) test. This
corpus is tagged with both POS and chunk tags.

Table 6 compares the results of ETL with DT
and TBL for the base NP chunking. We can see
that ETL, even using a small window size, produces
better results than DT and TBL. The Fβ=1 of the
ETLWS=9 classifier is 0.87% higher than the one of
TBL and 2.31% higher than the one of the DT clas-
sifier.

Table 7 shows the results of ETL using template
evolution. The template evolution strategy reduces
the average training time in approximately 62%.
Differently from the Portuguese NP chunking, we
observe an increase of the classifier efficacy in al-
most all the cases.

Table 8 shows the results of using a committee
composed by the eight ETL classifiers reported in
this section. Table 8 also shows the results for a
committee of SVM models presented in (Kudo and
Matsumoto, 2001). SVM’s results are the state-of-

3.3 English text chunking
The data used in the English text chunking exper-
iments is the CoNLL-2000 corpus, which is de-
scribed in (Sang and Buchholz, 2000). It is com-
posed by the same texts as the Ramshaw & Marcus
(Ramshaw and Marcus, 1999) corpus.

Table 9 compares the results of ETL with DTs and
TBL for English text chunking. ETL, even using a
small window size, produces better results than DTs
and TBL. The Fβ=1 of the ETLWS=3 classifier is
0.28% higher than the one of TBL and 2.17% higher
than the one of the DT classifier. It is an interesting
linguistic finding that the use of a window of size 3

(the current token, the previous token and the next
token) provides the current best results for this task.

Table 10 shows the results of ETL using template
evolution. The template evolution strategy reduces
the average training time by approximately 81%. On
the other hand, there is a small decrease of the clas-
sifier efficacy in all cases.

results are the state-of-the-art for the Text chunking
task. On the other hand, using a committee of ETL
classifiers, we produce very competitive results and
maintain the advantages of using a rule based sys-
tem.

3.4 Hindi text chunking

The data used in the Hindi text chunking exper-
iments is the SPSAL-2007 corpus, which is de-
scribed in (Bharati and Mannem, 2007). This cor-
pus is pre-divided into a 20000-tokens training set, a
5000-tokens development set and a 5000-tokens test
set. This corpus is tagged with both POS and chunk
tags.

To fairly compare our approach with the ones
presented in the SPSAL-2007, the POS tags of the
test corpus were replaced by the ones predicted by
an ETL-based Hindi POS Tagger. The description
of our ETL pos tagger is beyond the scope of this
work. Since the amount of training data is very small
(20000 tokens), the accuracy of the ETL Hindi POS
tagger is low, 77.50% for the test set.

The results are reported in terms of chunking ac-
curacy, the same performance measure used in the
SPSAL-2007. Table 13 compares the results of ETL
with DT and TBL for Hindi text chunking. ETL pro-
duces better results than DT and achieves the same
performance of TBL using 60% less templates. We
believe that ETL performance is not as good as in
the other tasks mainly because of the small amount
of training data, which increases the sparsity prob-
lem.

We do not use template evolution for Hindi text

chunking. Since the training corpus is very small,
the training time reduction is not significant.

Table 14 compares the results of ETL with the two
best Hindi text chunkers at SPSAL-2007 (Bharati
and Mannem, 2007). The first one is a combination
of Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and Conditional
Random Fields (CRF) (PVS and Gali, 2007). The
second is based in Maximum Entropy Models (Max-
Ent) (Dandapat, 2007). ETL performs better than
MaxEnt and worst than HMM+CRF. It is important
to note that the accuracy of the POS tagger used by
(PVS and Gali, 2007) (78.66%) is better than ours
(77.50%). The POS tagging quality directly affects
the chunking accuracy.

4 Conclusions

In this paper, we approach the phrase chunking
task using Entropy Guided Transformation Learning
(ETL). We carry out experiments with four phrase
chunking tasks: Portuguese noun phrase chunking,
English base noun phrase chunking, English text
chunking and Hindi text chunking. In all four tasks,
ETL shows better results than Decision Trees and
also than TBL with hand-crafted templates. ETL
provides a new training strategy that accelerates
transformation learning. For the English text chunk-
ing task this corresponds to a factor of five speedup.
For Portuguese noun phrase chunking, ETL shows
the best reported results for the task. For the other

three linguistic tasks, ETL shows competitive results
and maintains the advantages of using a rule based
system.
