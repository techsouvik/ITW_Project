Abstract

We present a novel framework for the dis-
covery and representation of general semantic
relationships that hold between lexical items.
We propose that each such relationship can be
identified with a cluster of patterns that cap-
tures this relationship. We give a fully unsu-
pervised algorithm for pattern cluster discov-
ery, which searches, clusters and merges high-
frequency words-based patterns around ran-
domly selected hook words. Pattern clusters
can be used to extract instances of the corre-
sponding relationships. To assess the quality
of discovered relationships, we use the pattern
clusters to automatically generate SAT anal-
ogy questions. We also compare to a set of
known relationships, achieving very good re-
sults in both methods. The evaluation (done
in both English and Russian) substantiates the
premise that our pattern clusters indeed reflect
relationships perceived by humans.

1 Introduction

Semantic resources can be very useful in many NLP
tasks. Manual construction of such resources is la-
bor intensive and susceptible to arbitrary human de-
cisions. In addition, manually constructed semantic
databases are not easily portable across text domains
or languages. Hence, there is a need for developing
semantic acquisition algorithms that are as unsuper-
vised and language independent as possible.

A fundamental type of semantic resource is that
of concepts (represented by sets of lexical items)
and their inter-relationships. While there is rel-
atively good agreement as to what concepts are

and which concepts should exist in a lexical re-
source, identifying types of important lexical rela-
tionships is a rather difficult task. Most established
resources (e.g., WordNet) represent only the main
and widely accepted relationships such as hyper-
nymy and meronymy. However, there are many
other useful relationships between concepts, such as
noun-modifier and inter-verb relationships. Identi-
fying and representing these explicitly can greatly
assist various tasks and applications. There are al-
ready applications that utilize such knowledge (e.g.,
(Tatu and Moldovan, 2005) for textual entailment).

One of the leading methods in semantics acqui-
sition is based on patterns (see e.g., (Hearst, 1992;
Pantel and Pennacchiotti, 2006)). The standard pro-
cess for pattern-based relation extraction is to start
with hand-selected patterns or word pairs express-
ing a particular relationship, and iteratively scan
the corpus for co-appearances of word pairs in pat-
terns and for patterns that contain known word pairs.
This methodology is semi-supervised, requiring pre-
specification of the desired relationship or hand-
coding initial seed words or patterns. The method
is quite successful, and examining its results in de-
tail shows that concept relationships are often being
manifested by several different patterns.

In this paper, unlike the majority of studies that
use patterns in order to find instances of given rela-
tionships, we use sets of patterns as the definitions
of lexical relationships. We introduce pattern clus-
ters, a novel framework in which each cluster cor-
responds to a relationship that can hold between the
lexical items that fill its patterns’ slots. We present
a fully unsupervised algorithm to compute pat-

692



tern clusters, not requiring any, even implicit, pre-
specification of relationship types or word/pattern
seeds. Our algorithm does not utilize preprocess-
ing such as POS tagging and parsing. Some patterns
may be present in several clusters, thus indirectly ad-
dressing pattern ambiguity.

The algorithm is comprised of the following
stages. First, we randomly select hook words and
create a context corpus (hook corpus) for each hook
word. Second, we define a meta-pattern using high
frequency words and punctuation. Third, in each
hook corpus, we use the meta-pattern to discover
concrete patterns and target words co-appearing
with the hook word. Fourth, we cluster the patterns
in each corpus according to co-appearance of the tar-
get words. Finally, we merge clusters from different
hook corpora to produce the final structure. We also
propose a way to label each cluster by word pairs
that represent it best.

Since we are dealing with relationships that are
unspecified in advance, assessing the quality of the
resulting pattern clusters is non-trivial. Our evalu-
ation uses two methods: SAT tests, and compari-
son to known relationships. We used instances of
the discovered relationships to automatically gener-
ate analogy SAT tests in two languages, English and
Russian1. Human subjects answered these and real
SAT tests. English grades were 80% for our test and
71% for the real test (83% and 79% for Russian),
showing that our relationship definitions indeed re-
flect human notions of relationship similarity. In ad-
dition, we show that among our pattern clusters there
are clusters that cover major known noun-compound
and verb-verb relationships.

In the present paper we focus on the pattern clus-
ter resource itself and how to evaluate its intrinsic
quality. In (Davidov and Rappoport, 2008) we show
how to use the resource for a known task of a to-
tally different nature, classification of relationships
between nominals (based on annotated data), obtain-
ing superior results over previous work.

Section 2 discusses related work, and Section 3
presents the pattern clustering and labeling algo-
rithm. Section 4 describes the corpora we used and
the algorithm’s parameters in detail. Sections 5 and

2 Related Work

Extraction of relation information from text is a
large sub-field in NLP. Major differences between
pattern approaches include the relationship types
sought (including domain restrictions), the degrees
of supervision and required preprocessing, and eval-
uation method.

2.1 Relationship Types

There is a large body of related work that deals with
discovery of basic relationship types represented in
useful resources such as WordNet, including hyper-
nymy (Hearst, 1992; Pantel et al., 2004; Snow
et al., 2006), synonymy (Davidov and Rappoport,
2006; Widdows and Dorow, 2002) and meronymy
(Berland and Charniak, 1999; Girju et al., 2006).

Since named entities are very important in NLP,
many studies define and discover relations between
named entities (Hasegawa et al., 2004; Hassan et
al., 2006). Work was also done on relations be-
tween verbs (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004). There
is growing research on relations between nominals
(Moldovan et al., 2004; Girju et al., 2007).

2.2 Degree of Supervision and Preprocessing

While numerous studies attempt to discover one or
more pre-specified relationship types, very little pre-
vious work has directly attempted the discovery of
which main types of generic relationships actually
exist in an unrestricted domain. Turney (2006) pro-
vided a pattern distance measure that allows a fully
unsupervised measurement of relational similarity
between two pairs of words; such a measure could
in principle be used by a clustering algorithm in or-
der to deduce relationship types, but this was not
discussed. Unlike (Turney, 2006), we do not per-
form any pattern ranking. Instead we produce (pos-
sibly overlapping) hard clusters, where each pattern
cluster represents a relationship discovered in the
domain. Banko et al. (2007) and Rosenfeld and
Feldman (2007) find relationship instances where
the relationships are not specified in advance. They
aim to find relationship instances rather than iden-
tify generic semantic relationships. Thus, their rep-
resentation is very different from ours. In addition,
(Banko et al., 2007) utilize supervised tools such

693



as a POS tagger and a shallow parser. Davidov et
al. (2007) proposed a method for unsupervised dis-
covery of concept-specific relations. That work, like
ours, relies on pattern clusters. However, it requires
initial word seeds and targets the discovery of rela-
tionships specific for some given concept, while we
attempt to discover and define generic relationships
that exist in the entire domain.

Studying relationships between tagged named en-
tities, (Hasegawa et al., 2004; Hassan et al., 2006)
proposed unsupervised clustering methods that as-
sign given sets of pairs into several clusters, where
each cluster corresponds to one of a known set of re-
lationship types. Their classification setting is thus
very different from our unsupervised discovery one.

Several recent papers discovered relations on the
web using seed patterns (Pantel et al., 2004), rules
(Etzioni et al., 2004), and word pairs (Pasca et al.,
2006; Alfonseca et al., 2006). The latter used the
notion of hook which we also use in this paper.
Several studies utilize some preprocessing, includ-
ing parsing (Hasegawa et al., 2004; Hassan et al.,
2006) and usage of syntactic (Suchanek et al., 2006)
and morphological (Pantel et al., 2004) informa-
tion in patterns. Several algorithms use manually-
prepared resources, including WordNet (Moldovan
et al., 2004; Costello et al., 2006) and Wikipedia
(Strube and Ponzetto, 2006). In this paper, we
do not utilize any language-specific preprocessing
or any other resources, which makes our algorithm
relatively easily portable between languages, as we
demonstrate in our bilingual evaluation.

2.3 Evaluation Method

Evaluation for hypernymy and synonymy usually
uses WordNet (Lin and Pantel, 2002; Widdows and
Dorow, 2002; Davidov and Rappoport, 2006). For
more specific lexical relationships like relationships
between verbs (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004), nom-
inals (Girju et al., 2004; Girju et al., 2007) or
meronymy subtypes (Berland and Charniak, 1999)
there is still little agreement which important rela-
tionships should be defined. Thus, there are more
than a dozen different type hierarchies and tasks pro-
posed for noun compounds (and nominals in gen-
eral), including (Nastase and Szpakowicz, 2003;
Girju et al., 2005; Girju et al., 2007).

There are thus two possible ways for a fair eval-

uation. A study can develop its own relationship
definitions and dataset, like (Nastase and Szpakow-
icz, 2003), thus introducing a possible bias; or it
can accept the definition and dataset prepared by
another work, like (Turney, 2006). However, this
makes it impossible to work on new relationship
types. Hence, when exploring very specific relation-
ship types or very generic, but not widely accepted,
types (like verb strength), many researchers resort
to manual human-based evaluation (Chklovski and
Pantel, 2004). In our case, where relationship types
are not specified in advance, creating an unbiased
benchmark is very problematic, so we rely on hu-
man subjects for relationship evaluation.

3 Pattern Clustering Algorithm

Our algorithm first discovers and clusters patterns in
which a single (‘hook’) word participates, and then
merges the resulting clusters to form the final struc-
ture. In this section we detail the algorithm. The
algorithm utilizes several parameters, whose selec-
tion is detailed in Section 4. We refer to a pattern
contained in our clusters (a pattern type) as a ‘pat-
tern’ and to an occurrence of a pattern in the corpus
(a pattern token) as a ‘pattern instance’.

3.1 Hook Words and Hook Corpora

As a first step, we randomly select a set of hook
words. Hook words were used in e.g. (Alfonseca
et al., 2006) for extracting general relations starting
from given seed word pairs. Unlike most previous
work, our hook words are not provided in advance
but selected randomly; the goal in those papers is
to discover relationships between given word pairs,
while we use hook words in order to discover rela-
tionships that generally occur in the corpus.

Only patterns in which a hook word actually par-
ticipates will eventually be discovered. Hence, in
principle we should select as many hook words as
possible. However, words whose frequency is very
high are usually ambiguous and are likely to produce
patterns that are too noisy, so we do not select words
with frequency higher than a parameter FC . In ad-
dition, we do not select words whose frequency is
below a threshold FB , to avoid selection of typos
and other noise that frequently appear on the web.

We also limit the total number N of hook words.

694



Our algorithm merges clusters originating from dif-
ferent hook words. Using too many hook words in-
creases the chance that some of them belong to a
noisy part in the corpus and thus lowers the quality
of our resulting clusters.

For each hook word, we now create a hook cor-
pus, the set of the contexts in which the word ap-
pears. Each context is a window containing W
words or punctuation characters before and after the
hook word. We avoid extracting text from clearly
unformatted sentences and our contexts do not cross
paragraph boundaries.

The size of each hook corpus is much smaller than
that of the whole corpus, easily fitting into main
memory; the corpus of a hook word occurring h
times in the corpus contains at most 2hW words.
Since most operations are done on each hook corpus
separately, computation is very efficient.

Note that such context corpora can in principle be
extracted by focused querying on the web, making
the system dynamically scalable. It is also possi-
ble to restrict selection of hook words to a specific
domain or word type, if we want to discover only
a desired subset of existing relationships. Thus we
could sample hook words from nouns, verbs, proper
names, or names of chemical compounds if we are
only interested in discovering relationships between
these. Selecting hook words randomly allows us to
avoid using any language-specific data at this step.

3.2 Pattern Specification

In order to reduce noise and to make the computa-
tion more efficient, we did not consider all contexts
of a hook word as pattern candidates, only contexts
that are instances of a specified meta-pattern type.
Following (Davidov and Rappoport, 2006), we clas-
sified words into high-frequency words (HFWs) and
content words (CWs). A word whose frequency is
more (less) than FH (FC) is considered to be a HFW
(CW). Unlike (Davidov and Rappoport, 2006), we
consider all punctuation characters as HFWs. Our
patterns have the general form

[Prefix] CW1 [Infix] CW2 [Postfix]

where Prefix, Infix and Postfix contain only HFWs.
To reduce the chance of catching CWi’s that are
parts of a multiword expression, we require Prefix
and Postfix to have at least one word (HFW), while

Infix is allowed to contain any number of HFWs (but
recall that the total length of a pattern is limited by
window size). A pattern example is ‘such X as Y
and’. During this stage we only allow single words
to be in CW slots2.

3.3 Discovery of Target Words

For each of the hook corpora, we now extract all
pattern instances where one CW slot contains the
hook word and the other CW slot contains some
other (‘target’) word. To avoid the selection of com-
mon words as target words, and to avoid targets ap-
pearing in pattern instances that are relatively fixed
multiword expressions, we sort all target words in
a given hook corpus by pointwise mutual informa-
tion between hook and target, and drop patterns ob-
tained from pattern instances containing the lowest
and highest L percent of target words.

3.4 Local Pattern Clustering

We now have for each hook corpus a set of patterns.
All of the corresponding pattern instances share the
hook word, and some of them also share a target
word. We cluster patterns in a two-stage process.
First, we group in clusters all patterns whose in-
stances share the same target word, and ignore the
rest. For each target word we have a single pattern
cluster. Second, we merge clusters that share more
than S percent of their patterns. A pattern can ap-
pear in more than a single cluster. Note that clusters
contain pattern types, obtained through examining
pattern instances.

3.5 Global Cluster Merging

The purpose of this stage is to create clusters of pat-
terns that express generic relationships rather than
ones specific to a single hook word. In addition,
the technique used in this stage reduces noise. For
each created cluster we will define core patterns and
unconfirmed patterns, which are weighed differently
during cluster labeling (see Section 3.6). We merge
clusters from different hook corpora using the fol-
lowing algorithm:

1. Remove all patterns originating from a single hook
corpus.

2While for pattern clusters creation we use only single words
as CWs, later during evaluation we allow multiword expressions
in CW slots of previously acquired patterns.

695



2. Mark all patterns of all present clusters as uncon-
firmed.

3. While there exists some cluster C1 from corpus DX
containing only unconfirmed patterns:

(a) Select a cluster with a minimal number of pat-
terns.

(b) For each corpus D different from DX :
i. Scan D for clusters C2 that share at least

S percent of their patterns, and all of their
core patterns, with C1.

ii. Add all patterns of C2 to C1, setting all
shared patterns as core and all others as
unconfirmed.

iii. Remove cluster C2.
(c) If all of C1’s patterns remain unconfirmed re-

move C1.
4. If several clusters have the same set of core patterns

merge them according to rules (i,ii).

We start from the smallest clusters because we ex-
pect these to be more precise; the best patterns for
semantic acquisition are those that belong to small
clusters, and appear in many different clusters. At
the end of this algorithm, we have a set of pattern
clusters where for each cluster there are two subsets,
core patterns and unconfirmed patterns.

3.6 Labeling of Pattern Clusters

To label pattern clusters we define a HITS measure
that reflects the affinity of a given word pair to a
given cluster. For a given word pair (w1, w2) and
cluster C with n core patterns Pcore and m uncon-
firmed patterns Punconf ,

Hits(C, (w1, w2)) =

|{p; (w1, w2) appears in p ∈ Pcore}| /n+
α × |{p; (w1, w2) appears in p ∈ Punconf}| /m.

In this formula, ‘appears in’ means that the word
pair appears in instances of this pattern extracted
from the original corpus or retrieved from the web
during evaluation (see Section 5.2). Thus if some
pair appears in most of patterns of some cluster it
receives a high HITS value for this cluster. The top
5 pairs for each cluster are selected as its labels.
α ∈ (0..1) is a parameter that lets us modify the
relative weight of core and unconfirmed patterns.

4 Corpora and Parameters

In this section we describe our experimental setup,
and discuss in detail the effect of each of the algo-
rithms’ parameters.

4.1 Languages and Corpora

The evaluation was done using corpora in English
and Russian. The English corpus (Gabrilovich and
Markovitch, 2005) was obtained through crawling
the URLs in the Open Directory Project (dmoz.org).
It contains about 8.2G words and its size is about
68GB of untagged plain text. The Russian corpus
was collected over the web, comprising a variety of
domains, including news, web pages, forums, nov-
els and scientific papers. It contains 7.5G words of
size 55GB untagged plain text. Aside from remov-
ing noise and sentence duplicates, we did not apply
any text preprocessing or tagging.

4.2 Parameters

Our algorithm uses the following parameters: FC ,
FH , FB , W , N , L, S and α. We used part of the
Russian corpus as a development set for determin-
ing the parameters. On our development set we have
tested various parameter settings. A detailed analy-
sis of the involved parameters is beyond the scope
of this paper; below we briefly discuss the observed
qualitative effects of parameter selection. Naturally,
the parameters are not mutually independent.

FC (upper bound for content word frequency in
patterns) influences which words are considered as
hook and target words. More ambiguous words gen-
erally have higher frequency. Since content words
determine the joining of patterns into clusters, the
more ambiguous a word is, the noisier the result-
ing clusters. Thus, higher values of FC allow more
ambiguous words, increasing cluster recall but also
increasing cluster noise, while lower ones increase
cluster precision at the expense of recall.

FH (lower bound for HFW frequency in patterns)
influences the specificity of patterns. Higher val-
ues restrict our patterns to be based upon the few
most common HFWs (like ‘the’, ‘of’, ‘and’) and
thus yield patterns that are very generic. Lowering
the values, we obtain increasing amounts of pattern
clusters for more specific relationships. The value
we use for FH is lower than that used for FC , in or-
der to allow as HFWs function words of relatively
low frequency (e.g., ‘through’), while allowing as
content words some frequent words that participate
in meaningful relationships (e.g., ‘game’). However,
this way we may also introduce more noise.

696



FB (lower bound for hook words) filters hook
words that do not appear enough times in the cor-
pus. We have found that this parameter is essential
for removing typos and other words that do not qual-
ify as hook words.

N (number of hook words) influences relation-
ship coverage. With higher N values we discover
more relationships roughly of the same specificity
level, but computation becomes less efficient and
more noise is introduced.

W (window size) determines the length of the dis-
covered patterns. Lower values are more efficient
computationally, but values that are too low result in
drastic decrease in coverage. Higher values would
be more useful when we allow our algorithm to sup-
port multiword expressions as hooks and targets.

L (target word mutual information filter) helps in
avoiding using as targets common words that are
unrelated to hooks, while still catching as targets
frequent words that are related. Low L values de-
crease pattern precision, allowing patterns like ‘give
X please Y more’, where X is the hook (e.g., ‘Alex’)
and Y the target (e.g., ‘some’). High values increase
pattern precision at the expense of recall.

S (minimal overlap for cluster merging) is a clus-
ters merge filter. Higher values cause more strict
merging, producing smaller but more precise clus-
ters, while lower values start introducing noise. In
extreme cases, low values can start a chain reaction
of total merging.

α (core vs. unconfirmed weight for HITS labeling)
allows lower quality patterns to complement higher
quality ones during labeling. Higher values increase
label noise, while lower ones effectively ignore un-
confirmed patterns during labeling.

In our experiments we have used the following
values (again, determined using a development set)
for these parameters: FC : 1, 000 words per mil-
lion (wpm); FH : 100 wpm; FB: 1.2 wpm; N : 500
words; W : 5 words; L: 30%; S: 2/3; α: 0.1.

5 SAT-based Evaluation

As discussed in Section 2, the evaluation of semantic
relationship structures is non-trivial. The goal of our
evaluation was to assess whether pattern clusters in-
deed represent meaningful, precise and different re-
lationships. There are two complementary perspec-

tives that a pattern clusters quality assessment needs
to address. The first is the quality (precision/recall)
of individual pattern clusters: does each pattern clus-
ter capture lexical item pairs of the same semantic
relationship? does it recognize many pairs of the
same semantic relationship? The second is the qual-
ity of the cluster set as whole: does the pattern clus-
ters set allow identification of important known se-
mantic relationships? do several pattern clusters de-
scribe the same relationship?

Manually examining the resulting pattern clus-
ters, we saw that the majority of sampled clusters in-
deed clearly express an interesting specific relation-
ship. Examples include familiar hypernymy clusters
such as3 {‘such X as Y’, ‘X such as Y’, ‘Y and other
X’,} with label (pets, dogs), and much more specific
clusters like { ‘buy Y accessory for X!’, ‘shipping Y
for X’, ‘Y is available for X’, ‘Y are available for X’,
‘Y are available for X systems’, ‘Y for X’ }, labeled
by (phone, charger). Some clusters contain overlap-
ping patterns, like ‘Y for X’, but represent different
relationships when examined as a whole.

We addressed the evaluation questions above us-
ing a SAT-like analogy test automatically generated
from word pairs captured by our clusters (see below
in this section). In addition, we tested coverage and
overlap of pattern clusters with a set of 35 known re-
lationships, and we compared our patterns to those
found useful by other algorithms (the next section).

Quantitatively, the final number of clusters is 508
(470) for English (Russian), and the average cluster
size is 5.5 (6.1) pattern types. 55% of the clusters
had no overlap with other clusters.

5.1 SAT Analogy Choice Test

Our main evaluation method, which is also a use-
ful application by itself, uses our pattern clusters to
automatically generate SAT analogy questions. The
questions were answered by human subjects.

We randomly selected 15 clusters. This allowed
us to assess the precision of the whole cluster set as
well as of the internal coherence of separate clus-
ters (see below). For each cluster, we constructed
a SAT analogy question in the following manner.
The header of the question is a word pair that is one
of the label pairs of the cluster. The five multiple

697



choice items include: (1) another label of the clus-
ter (the ‘correct’ answer); (2) three labels of other
clusters among the 15; and (3) a pair constructed by
randomly selecting words from those making up the
various cluster labels.

In our sample there were no word pairs assigned
as labels to more than one cluster4. As a baseline for
comparison, we have mixed these questions with 15
real SAT questions taken from English and Russian
SAT analogy tests. In addition, we have also asked
our subjects to write down one example pair of the
same relationship for each question in the test.

As an example, from one of the 15 clusters we
have randomly selected the label (glass, water). The
correct answer selected from the same cluster was
(schoolbag, book). The three pairs randomly se-
lected from the other 14 clusters were (war, death),
(request, license) and (mouse, cat). The pair ran-
domly selected from a cluster not among the 15 clus-
ters was (milk, drink). Among the subjects’ propos-
als for this question were (closet, clothes) and (wal-
let, money).

We computed accuracy of SAT answers, and the
correlation between answers for our questions and
the real ones (Table 1). Three things are demon-
strated about our system when humans are capable
of selecting the correct answer. First, our clusters
are internally coherent in the sense of expressing a
certain relationship, because people identified that
the pairs in the question header and in the correct
answer exhibit the same relationship. Second, our
clusters distinguish between different relationships,
because the three pairs not expressing the same rela-
tionship as the header were not selected by the evalu-
ators. Third, our cluster labeling algorithm produces
results that are usable by people.

The test was performed in both English and Rus-
sian, with 10 (6) subjects for English (Russian).
The subjects (biology and CS students) were not in-
volved with the research, did not see the clusters,
and did not receive any special training as prepara-
tion. Inter-subject agreement and Kappa were 0.82,
0.72 (0.9, 0.78) for English (Russian). As reported
in (Turney, 2005), an average high-school SAT
grade is 57. Table 1 shows the final English and Rus-

4But note that a pair can certainly obtain a positive HITS
value for several clusters.

sian grade average for ours and real SAT questions.
We can see that for both languages, around 80%

of the choices were correct (the random choice base-
line is 20%). Our subjects are university students,
so results higher than 57 are expected, as we can
see from real SAT performance. The difference
in grades between the two languages might be at-
tributed to the presence of relatively hard and un-
common words. It also may result from the Russian
test being easier because there is less verb-noun am-
biguity in Russian.

We have observed a high correlation between true
grades and ours, suggesting that our automatically
generated test reflects the ability to recognize analo-
gies and can be potentially used for automated gen-
eration of SAT-like tests.

The results show that our pattern clusters indeed
mirror a human notion of relationship similarity and
represent meaningful relationships. They also show
that as intended, different clusters describe different
relationships.

5.2 Analogy Invention Test

To assess recall of separate pattern clusters, we have
asked subjects to provide (if possible) an additional
pair for each SAT question. On each such pair
we have automatically extracted a set of pattern in-
stances that capture this pair by using automated
web queries. Then we calculated the HITS value for
each of the selected pairs and assigned them to clus-
ters with highest HITS value. The numbers of pairs
provided were 81 for English and 43 for Russian.

We have estimated precision for this task as
macro-average of percentage of correctly assigned
pairs, obtaining 87% for English and 82% for Rus-
sian (the random baseline of this 15-class classifi-
cation task is 6.7%). It should be noted however
that the human-provided additional relationship ex-
amples in this test are not random so it may intro-
duce bias. Nevertheless, these results confirm that
our pattern clusters are able to recognize new in-

6 Evaluation Using Known Information

We also evaluated our pattern clusters using relevant
information reported in related work.

6.1 Discovery of Known Relationships

To estimate recall of our pattern cluster set, we
attempted to estimate whether (at least) a subset
of known relationships have corresponding pattern
clusters. As a testing subset, we have used 35 re-
lationships for both English and Russian. 30 rela-
tions are noun compound relationships as proposed
in the (Nastase and Szpakowicz, 2003) classifica-
tion scheme, and 5 relations are verb-verb relations
proposed by (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004). We
have manually created sets of 5 unambiguous sam-
ple pairs for each of these 35 relationships. For each
such pair we have assigned the pattern cluster with
best HITS value.

The middle column of Table 2 shows the average
number of clusters per relationship. Ideally, if for
each relationship all 5 pairs are assigned to the same
cluster, the average would be 1. In the worst case,
when each pair is assigned to a different cluster, the
average would be 5. We can see that most of the
pairs indeed fall into one or two clusters, success-
fully recognizing that similarly related pairs belong
to the same cluster. The column on the right shows
the overlap between different clusters, measured as
the average number of shared pairs in two randomly
selected clusters. The baseline in this case is essen-
tially 5, since there are more than 400 clusters for 5
word pairs. We see a very low overlap between as-
signed clusters, which shows that these clusters in-
deed separate well between defined relations.

6.2 Discovery of Known Pattern Sets

We compared our clusters to lists of patterns re-
ported as useful by previous papers. These lists
included patterns expressing hypernymy (Hearst,
1992; Pantel et al., 2004), meronymy (Berland and
Charniak, 1999; Girju et al., 2006), synonymy
(Widdows and Dorow, 2002; Davidov and Rap-
poport, 2006), and verb strength + verb happens-
before (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004). In all cases,
we discovered clusters containing all of the reported
patterns (including their refinements with domain-
specific prefix or postfix) and not containing patterns
of competing relationships.

7 Conclusion

We have proposed a novel way to define and identify
generic lexical relationships as clusters of patterns.
Each such cluster is set of patterns that can be used
to identify, classify or capture new instances of some
unspecified semantic relationship. We showed how
such pattern clusters can be obtained automatically
from text corpora without any seeds and without re-
lying on manually created databases or language-
specific text preprocessing. In an evaluation based
on an automatically created analogy SAT test we
showed on two languages that pairs produced by our
clusters indeed strongly reflect human notions of re-
lation similarity. We also showed that the obtained
pattern clusters can be used to recognize new ex-
amples of the same relationships. In an additional
test where we assign labeled pairs to pattern clus-
ters, we showed that they provide good coverage for
known noun-noun and verb-verb relationships for
both tested languages.

While our algorithm shows good performance,
there is still room for improvement. It utilizes a set
of constants that affect precision, recall and the gran-
ularity of the extracted cluster set. It would be ben-
eficial to obtain such parameters automatically and
to create a multilevel relationship hierarchy instead
of a flat one, thus combining different granularity
levels. In this study we applied our algorithm to a
generic domain, while the same method can be used
for more restricted domains, potentially discovering
useful domain-specific relationships.
