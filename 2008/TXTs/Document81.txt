Abstract

Web search engines today typically show re-
sults as a list of titles and short snippets that
summarize how the retrieved documents are
related to the query. However, recent research
suggests that longer summaries can be prefer-
able for certain types of queries. This pa-
per presents empirical evidence that judges
can predict appropriate search result summary
lengths, and that perceptions of search result
quality can be affected by varying these result
lengths. These findings have important impli-
cations for search results presentation, espe-
cially for natural language queries.

1 Introduction

Search results listings on the web have become stan-
dardized as a list of information summarizing the
retrieved documents. This summary information is
often referred to as the document’s surrogate (Mar-
chionini et al., 2008).

In older search systems, such as those used in
news and legal search, the document surrogate typ-
ically consisted of the title and important metadata,
such as date, author, source, and length of the article,
as well as the document’s manually written abstract.
In most cases, the full text content of the document
was not available to the search engine and so no ex-
tracts could be made.

In web search, document surrogates typically
show the web page’s title, a URL, and information
extracted from the full text contents of the docu-
ment. This latter part is referred to by several dif-
ferent names, including summary, abstract, extract,

and snippet. Today it is standard for web search en-
gines to show these summaries as one or two lines
of text, often with ellipses separating sentence frag-
ments. However, there is evidence that the ideal re-
sult length is often longer than the standard snippet
length, and that furthermore, result length depends
on the type of answer being sought.

In this paper, we systematically examine the ques-
tion of search result length preference, comparing
different result lengths for different query types. We
find evidence that desired answer length is sensitive
to query type, and that for some queries longer an-
swers are judged to be of higher quality.

In the following sections we summarize the re-
lated work on result length variation and on query
topic classification. We then describe two studies. In
the first, judges examined queries and made predic-
tions about the expected answer types and the ideal
answer lengths. In the second study, judges rated
answers of different lengths for these queries. The
studies find evidence supporting the idea that differ-
ent query types are best answered with summaries
of different lengths.

2.1 Query-biased Summaries

In the early days of the web, the result summary
consisted of the first few lines of text, due both to
concerns about intellectual property, and because of-
ten that was the only part of the full text that the
search engines retained from their crawls. Eventu-
ally, search engines started showing what are known
variously as query-biased summaries, keyword-in-

701



context (KWIC) extractions, and user-directed sum-
maries (Tombros and Sanderson, 1998). In these
summaries, sentence fragments, full sentences, or
groups of sentences that contain query terms are ex-
tracted from the full text. Early versions of this idea
were developed in the Snippet Search tool (Peder-
sen et al., 1991) and the Superbook tool’s Table-of-
Contents view (Egan et al., 1989).

A query-biased summary shows sentences that
summarize the ways the query terms are used within
the document. In addition to showing which subsets
of query terms occur in a retrieved document, this
display also exposes the context in which the query
terms appear with respect to one another.

Research suggests that query-biased summaries
are superior to showing the first few sentences from
documents. Tombros & Sanderson (1998), in a
study with 20 participants using TREC ad hoc data,
found higher precision and recall and higher sub-
jective preferences for query-biased summaries over
summaries showing the first few sentences. Simi-
lar results for timing and subjective measurements
were found by White et al. (2003) in a study with
24 participants. White et al. (2003) also describe
experiments with different sentence selection mech-
anisms, including giving more weight to sentences
that contained query words along with text format-
ting.

There are significant design questions surround-
ing how best to formulate and display query-biased
summaries. As with standard document summariza-
tion and extraction, there is an inherent trade-off
between showing long, informative summaries and
minimizing the screen space required by each search
hit. There is also a tension between showing short
snippets that contain all or most of the query terms
and showing coherent stretches of text. If the query
terms do not co-occur near one another, then the ex-
tract has to become very long if full sentences and
all query terms are to be shown. Many web search
engine snippets compromise by showing fragments
instead of sentences.

2.2 Studies Comparing Results Lengths

Recently, a few studies have analyzed the results of
varying search summary length.

In the question-answering context (as opposed to
general web search), Lin et al. (2003) conducted

a usability study with 32 computer science students
comparing four types of answer context: exact an-
swer, answer-in-sentence, answer-in-paragraph, and
answer-in-document. To remove effects of incorrect
answers, they used a system that produced only cor-
rect answers, drawn from an online encyclopedia.
Participants viewed answers for 8 question scenar-
ios. Lin et al. (2003) found no significant differ-
ences in task completion times, but they did find dif-
ferences in subjective responses. Most participants
(53%) preferred paragraph-sized chunks, noting that
a sentence wasn’t much more information beyond
the exact answer, and a full document was often-
times too long. That said, 23% preferred full docu-
ments, 20% preferred sentences, and one participant
preferred exact answer, thus suggesting that there is
considerable individual variation.

Paek et al. (2004) experimented with showing dif-
fering amounts of summary information in results
listings, controlling the study design so that only
one result in each list of 10 was relevant. For half
the test questions, the target information was visi-
ble in the original snippet, and for the other half, the
participant needed to use their mouse to view more
information from the relevant search result. They
compared three interface conditions:

(i) a standard search results listing, in which a
mouse click on the title brings up the full text
of the web page,

(ii) “instant” view, for which a mouseclick ex-
panded the document summary to show addi-
tional sentences from the document, and those
sentences contained query terms and the an-
swer to the search task, and

(iii) a “dynamic” view that responded to a mouse
hover, and dynamically expanded the summary
with a few words at a time.

Eleven out of 18 participants preferred instant
view over the other two views, and on average all
participants produced faster and more accurate re-
sults with this view. Seven participants preferred dy-
namic view over the others, but many others found
this view disruptive. The dynamic view suffered
from the problem that, as the text expanded, the
mouse no longer covered the selected results, and

702



so an unintended, different search result sometimes
started to expand. Notably, none of the participants
preferred the standard results listing view.

Cutrell & Guan (2007), compared search sum-
maries of varying length: short (1 line of text),
medium (2-3 lines) and long (6-7 lines) using search
engine-produced snippets (it is unclear if the sum-
mary text was contiguous or included ellipses).
They also compared 6 navigational queries (where
the goal is to find a website’s homepage), with 6 in-
formational queries (e.g., “find when the Titanic set
sail for its only voyage and what port it left from,”
“find out how long the Las Vegas monorail is”). In
a study with 22 participants, they found that partic-
ipants were 24 seconds faster on average with the
long view than with the short and medium view. The
also found that participants were 10 seconds slower
on average with the long view for the navigational
tasks. They present eye tracking evidence which
suggests that on the navigational task, the extra text
distracts the eye from the URL. They did not re-
port on subjective responses to the different answer
lengths.

Rose et al. (2007) varied search results summaries
along several dimensions, finding that text choppi-
ness and sentence truncation had negative effects,
and genre cues had positive effects. They did not
find effects for varying summary length, but they
only compared relatively similar summary lengths
(2 vs. 3 vs. 4 lines long).

2.3 Categorizing Questions by Expected
Answer Types

In the field of automated question-answering, much
effort has been expended on automatically deter-
mining the kind of answer that is expected for a
given question. The candidate answer types are
often drawn from the types of questions that have
appeared in the TREC Question Answering track
(Voorhees, 2003). For example, the Webclopedia
project created a taxonomy of 180 types of ques-
tion targets (Hovy et al., 2002), and the FALCON
project (Harabagiu et al., 2003) developed an an-
swer taxonomy with 33 top level categories (such
as PERSON, TIME, REASON, PRODUCT, LOCA-
TION, NUMERICAL VALUE, QUOTATION), and
these were further refined into an unspecified num-
ber of additional categories. Ramakrishnan et al.

(2004) show an automated method for determining
expected answer types using syntactic information
and mapping query terms to WordNet.

2.4 Categorizing Web Queries

A different line of research is the query log cate-
gorization problem. In query logs, the queries are
often much more terse and ill-defined than in the
TREC QA track, and, accordingly, the taxonomies
used to classify what is called the query intent have
been much more general.

In an attempt to demonstrate how information
needs for web search differ from the assumptions
of pre-web information retrieval systems, Broder
(2002) created a taxonomy of web search goals, and
then estimated frequency of such goals by a com-
bination of an online survey (3,200 responses, 10%
response rate) and a manual analysis of 1,000 query
from the AltaVista query logs. This taxonomy has
been heavily influential in discussions of query types
on the Web.

Rose & Levinson (2004) followed up on Broder’s
work, again using web query logs, but developing
a taxonomy that differed somewhat from Broder’s.
They manually classified a set of 1,500 AltaVista
search engine log queries. For two sets of 500
queries, the labeler saw just the query and the re-
trieved documents; for the third set the labeler also
saw information about which item(s) the searcher
clicked on. They found that the classifications that
used the extra information about clickthrough did
not change the proportions of assignments to each
category. Because they did not directly compare
judgments with and without click information on
the same queries, this is only weak evidence that
query plus retrieved documents is sufficient to clas-
sify query intent.

Alternatively, queries from web query logs can be
classified according to the topic of the query, inde-
pendent of the type of information need. For ex-
ample, a search involving the topic of weather can
consist of the simple information need of looking
at today’s forecast, or the rich and complex infor-
mation need of studying meteorology. Over many
years, Spink & Jansen et al. (2006; 2007) have man-
ually analyzed samples of query logs to track a num-
ber of different trends. One of the most notable is
the change in topic mix. As an alternative to man-

703



ual classification of query topics, Shen et al. (2005)
described an algorithm for automatically classifying
web queries into a set of pre-defined topics. More re-
cently, Broder et al. (2007) presented a highly accu-
rate method (around .7 F-score) for classifying short,
rare queries into a taxonomy of 6,000 categories.

3 Study Goals

Related work suggests that longer results are prefer-
able, but not for all query types. The goal of our
efforts was to determine preferred result length for
search results, depending on type of query. To do
this, we performed two studies:

1. We asked a set of judges to categorize a large
set of web queries according to their expected
preferred response type and expected preferred
response length.

2. We then developed high-quality answer pas-
sages of different lengths for a subset of these
queries by selecting appropriate passages from
the online encyclopedia Wikipedia, and asked
judges to rate the quality of these answers.

The results of this study should inform search in-
terface designers about what the best presentation
format is.

3.1 Using Mechanical Turk

For these studies, we make use of a web service of-
fered by Amazon.com called Mechanical Turk, in
which participants (called “turkers”) are paid small
sums of money in exchange for work on “Human
Intelligence tasks” (HITs).1 These HITs are gener-
ated from an XML description of the task created
by the investigator (called a “requester”). The par-
ticipants can come from any walk of life, and their
identity is not known to the requesters. We have in
past work found the results produced by these judges
to be of high quality, and have put into place vari-
ous checks to detect fraudulent behavior. Other re-
searchers have investigated the efficacy of language

1Website: http://www.mturk.com. For experiment 1, ap-
proximately 38,000 HITs were completed at a cost of about
$1,500. For experiment 2, approximately 7,300 HITs were
completed for about $170. Turkers were paid between $.01 and
$.05 per HIT depending on task complexity; Amazon imposes
additional charges.

2. Organization(s)
3. Time(s) (date, year, time span etc.)
4. Number or Quantity
5. Geographic Location(s) (e.g., city, lake, address)
6. Place(s) (e.g.,”the White House”, “at a supermar-
ket”)
7. Obtain resource online (e.g., movies, lyrics, books,
magazines, knitting patterns)
8. Website or URL
9. Purchase and product information
10. Gossip and celebrity information
11. Language-related (e.g., translations, definitions,
crossword puzzle answers)
12. General information about a topic

annotation using this service and have found that the
results are of high quality (Su et al., 2007).

3.2 Estimating Ideal Answer Length and Type

We developed a set of 12,790 queries, drawn from
Powerset’s in house query database which con-
tains representative subsets of queries from different
search engines’ query logs, as well as hand-edited
query sets used for regression testing. There are a
disproportionally large number of natural language
queries in this set compared with query sets from
typical keyword engines. Such queries are often
complete questions and are sometimes grammatical
fragments (e.g., “date of next US election”) and so
are likely to be amenable to interesting natural lan-
guage processing algorithms, which is an area of in-

704



Figure 1: Results of the first experiment. The y-axis shows the semantic type of the predicted answer, in the same
order as listed in Table 1; the x-axis shows the preferred length as listed in Table 2. Three bars with length greater
than 1,500 are trimmed to the maximum size to improve readability (GeneralInfo/Paragraphs, GeneralInfo/Article,
and Number/Phrase).

terest of our research. The average number of words
per query (as determined by white space separation)
was 5.8 (sd. 2.9) and the average number of char-
acters (including punctuation and white space) was
32.3 (14.9). This is substantially longer than the cur-
rent average for web search query, which was ap-
proximately 2.8 in 2005 (Jansen et al., 2007); this is
due to the existence of natural language queries.

Judges were asked to classify each query accord-
ing to its expected response type into one of 17 cat-
egories (see Table 1). These categories include an-
swer types used in question answering research as
well as (to better capture the diverse nature of web
queries) several more general response types such
as Advice and General Information. Additionally,
we asked judges to anticipate what the best result
length would be for the query, as shown in Table 2.

Each of the 12,790 queries received three assess-
ments by MTurk judges. For answer types, the
number of times all three judges agreed was 4537
(35.4%); two agreed 6030 times (47.1%), and none

agreed 2223 times (17.4%). Not surprisingly, there
was significant overlap between the label General-
Info and the other categories. For answer length
estimations, all three judges agreed in 2361 cases
(18.5%), two agreed in 7210 cases (56.4%) and none
3219 times (25.2%).

Figure 1 summarizes expected length judgments
by estimated answer category. Distribution of the
length categories differs a great deal across the in-
dividual expected response categories. In general,
the results are intuitive: judges preferred short re-
sponses for “precise queries” (e.g., those asking for
numbers) and they preferred longer responses for
queries in broad categories like Advice or Gener-
alInfo. But some results are less intuitive: for ex-
ample, judges preferred different response lengths
for queries categorized as Person and Organization
– in fact for the latter the largest single selection
made was List. Reviewing the queries for these
two categories, we note that most queries about or-
ganizations in our collection asked for companies

(e.g. “around the world travel agency”) and for
these there usually is more than one correct answer,
whereas the queries about persons (“CEO of mi-
crosoft” ) typically only had one relevant answer.
The results of this table show that there are some
trends but not definitive relationships between query
type (as classified in this study) and expected answer
length. More detailed classifications might help re-
solve some of the conflicts.

3.3 Result Length Study

The purpose of the second study was twofold: first,
to see if doing a larger study confirms what is hinted
at in the literature: that search result lengths longer
than the standard snippet may be desirable for at
least a subset of queries. Second, we wanted to
see if judges’ predictions of desirable results lengths
would be confirmed by other judges’ responses to
search results of different lengths.

3.3.1 Method

It has been found that obtaining judges’ agree-
ment on intent of a query from a log can be difficult
(Rose and Levinson, 2004; Kellar et al., 2007). In
order to make the task of judging query relevance
easier, for the next phase of the study we focused
on only those queries for which all three assessors
in the first experiment agreed both on the category
label and on the estimated ideal length. There were
1099 such high-confidence queries, whose average
number of words was 6.3 (2.9) and average number
of characters was 34.5 (14.3).

We randomly selected a subset of the high-
agreement queries from the first experiment and
manually excluded queries for which it seemed ob-
vious that no responses could be found in Wikipedia.
These included queries about song lyrics, since in-
tellectual property restrictions prevent these being
posted, and crossword puzzle questions such as “a
four letter word for water.”

The remaining set contained 170 queries. MTurk
annotators were asked to find one good text passage
(in English) for each query from the Wikipedia on-
line encyclopedia. They were also asked to subdi-
vide the text of this answer into each of the following
lengths: a word or phrase, a sentence, a paragraph,
a section or an entire article.2 Thus, the shorter an-
swer passages are subsumed by the longer ones.

Table 3 shows the average lengths and standard
deviations of each result length type. Table 4 con-
tains sample answers for the shorter length formats
for one query. For 24 of the 170 queries the annota-
tors could not find a suitable response in Wikipedia,
e.g., “How many miles between NY and Milwau-
kee?” We collected two to five results for each of the
remaining 146 queries and manually chose the best
of these answer passages. Note that, by design, all
responses were factually correct; they only differed
in their length.

Ten MTurk judges saw each query/answer length
pair, and for each of these, were told: “Below you
see a search engine query and a possible response.
We would like you to give us your opinion about the
response. We are especially interested in the length
of the response. Is it suitable for the query? Is there
too much or not enough information? Please rate the
response on a scale from 0 (very bad response) to 10
(very good response).” There were 124 judges in to-
tal; of these, 16 did more than 146 HITs, meaning
they saw the same query more than one time (but
with different lengths). Upon examination of the re-
sults, we determined that two of these high-volume
judges were not trying to do the task properly, and so
we dropped their judgments from the final analysis.

3.3.2 Results

Our results show that judges prefer results of dif-
ferent lengths, depending on the query. The re-
sults also suggest that judges’ estimates of a pre-
ferred result length in the first experiment are ac-
curate predictors when there is strong agreement
among them. Figure 2 shows in four diagrams

the first and second experiment: The List and Other options
were dropped for the second experiment because we wanted to
concentrate on textual length. Additionally, to provide more
than one option between Sentence and Article, the category

graph and (One) Section.

Paragraph An Italian expedition finally succeeded in ascending to the summit of K2 on July 31, 1954.

The expedition was led by Ardito Desio, although the two climbers who actually reached
the top were Lino Lacedelli and Achille Compagnoni. The team included a Pakistani mem-
ber, Colonel Muhammad Ata-ullah. He had been a part of an earlier 1953 American expe-
dition which failed to make the summit because of a storm which killed a key climber, Art
Gilkey. On the expedition also was the famous Italian climber Walter Bonatti. He proved
vital to the expeditions success in that he carried vital oxygen to 26,600ft for Lacedelli
and Compagnoni. His dramatic bivouac, at that altitude with the equipment, wrote another
chapter in the saga of Himalayan climbing.

data for the second experiment, which was separated into
four groups based on the predicted preferred length.

how queries assigned by judges to one of the four
length categories from the first experiment were
judged when presented with responses of the five
answer lengths from the second experiment. The
graphs show the means and standard error of the
judges’ scores across all queries for each predicted-
length/presented-length combination.

In order to test whether these results are signifi-
cant we performed four separate linear regressions;
one for each of the predicted preferred length cat-
egories. The snippet length, the independent vari-
able, was coded as 1-5, shortest to longest. The
score for each query-snippet pair is the dependent
variable. Table 5 shows that for each group there is
evidence to reject the null hypothesis that the slope
is equal to 0 at the 99% confidence level. High
scores are associated with shorter snippet lengths
for queries with predicted preferred length phrase
or sentence and also with longer snippet lengths for
queries with predicted preferred length paragraphs
or article. These associations are strongest for the
queries with the most extreme predicted preferred
lengths (phrase and article).

Our results also suggest the intuition that the best
answer lengths do not form strictly distinct classes,
but rather lie on a continuum. If the ideal response is
from a certain category (e.g., a sentence), returning a
result from an adjacent category (a phrase or a para-
graph) is not strongly penalized by judges, whereas
retuning a result from a category further up or down
the scale (an article) is.

One potential drawback of this study format is
that we do not show judges a list of results for
queries, as is standard in search engines, and so they
do not experience the tradeoff effect of longer results
requiring more scrolling if the desired answer is not
shown first. However, the earlier results of Cutrell &
Guan (2007) and Paek et al. (2004) suggest that the

preference for longer results occurs even in contexts
that require looking through multiple results. An-
other potential drawback of the study is that judges
only view one relevant result; the effects of showing
a list of long non-relevant results may be more neg-
ative than that of showing short non-relevant results;
this study would not capture that effect.

4 Conclusions and Future Work

Our studies suggest that different queries are best
served with different response lengths (Experi-
ment 1), and that for a subset of especially clear
queries, human judges can predict the preferred re-
sult lengths (Experiment 2). The results furthermore
support the contention that standard results listings
are too short in many cases, at least assuming that
the summary shows information that is relevant for
the query. These findings have important implica-
tions for the design of search results presentations,
suggesting that as user queries become more expres-
sive, search engine results should become more re-
sponsive to the type of answer desired. This may
mean showing more context in the results listing, or
perhaps using more dynamic tools such as expand-
on-mouseover to help answer the query in place.

The obvious next step is to determine how to au-
tomatically classify queries according to their pre-
dicted result length and type. For classifying ac-
cording to expected length, we have run some initial
experiments based on unigram word counts which
correctly classified 78% of 286 test queries (on 805
training queries) into one of three length bins. We
plan to pursue this further in future work. For classi-
fying according to type, as discussed above, most
automated query classification for web logs have
been based on the topic of the query rather than on
the intended result type, but the question answering
literature has intensively investigated how to pre-
dict appropriate answer types. It is likely that the
techniques from these two fields can be productively
combined to address this challenge.
