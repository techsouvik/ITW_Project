Abstract

Different summarization requirements could
make the writing of a good summary more dif-
ficult, or easier. Summary length and the char-
acteristics of the input are such constraints in-
fluencing the quality of a potential summary.
In this paper we report the results of a quanti-
tative analysis on data from large-scale evalu-
ations of multi-document summarization, em-
pirically confirming this hypothesis. We fur-
ther show that features measuring the cohe-
siveness of the input are highly correlated with
eventual summary quality and that it is possi-
ble to use these as features to predict the diffi-
culty of new, unseen, summarization inputs.

1 Introduction

In certain situations even the best automatic sum-
marizers or professional writers can find it hard to
write a good summary of a set of articles. If there
is no clear topic shared across the input articles, or
if they follow the development of the same event in
time for a longer period, it could become difficult
to decide what information is most representative
and should be conveyed in a summary. Similarly,
length requirements could pre-determine summary
quality—a short outline of a story might be confus-
ing and unclear but a page long discussion might
give an excellent overview of the same issue.

Even systems that perform well on average pro-
duce summaries of poor quality for some inputs. For
this reason, understanding what aspects of the in-
put make it difficult for summarization becomes an
interesting and important issue that has not been ad-
dressed in the summarization community untill now.

In information retrieval, for example, the variable
system performance has been recognized as a re-
search challenge and numerous studies on identify-
ing query difficulty have been carried out (most re-
cently (Cronen-Townsend et al., 2002; Yom-Tov et
al., 2005; Carmel et al., 2006)).

In this paper we present results supporting the hy-
potheses that input topicality cohesiveness and sum-
mary length are among the factors that determine
summary quality regardless of the choice of summa-
rization strategy (Section 2). The data used for the
analyses comes from the annual Document Under-
standing Conference (DUC) in which various sum-
marization approaches are evaluated on common
data, with new test sets provided each year.

In later sections we define a suite of features cap-
turing aspects of the topicality cohesiveness of the
input (Section 3) and relate these to system perfor-
mance, identifying reliable correlates of input diffi-
culty (Section 4). Finally, in Section 5, we demon-
strate that the features can be used to build a clas-
sifier predicting summarization input difficulty with
accuracy considerably above chance level.

2 Preliminary analysis and distinctions:
DUC 2001

Generic multi-document summarization was fea-
tured as a task at the Document Understanding Con-
ference (DUC) in four years, 2001 through 2004.
In our study we use the DUC 2001 multi-document
task submissions as development data for in-depth
analysis and feature selection. There were 29 in-
put sets and 12 automatic summarizers participating
in the evaluation that year. Summaries of different

825



lengths were produced by each system: 50, 100, 200
and 400 words. Each summary was manually eval-
uated to determine the extent to which its content
overlaped with that of a human model, giving a cov-
erage score. The content comparison was performed
on a subsentence level and was based on elementary
discourse units in the model summary.1

The coverage scores are taken as an indicator of
difficultly of the input: systems achieve low cover-
age for difficult sets and higher coverage for easy
sets. Since we are interested in identifying charac-
teristics of generally difficult inputs rather than in
discovering what types of inputs might be difficult
for one given system, we use the average system
score per set as indicator of general difficulty.

2.1 Analysis of variance

Before attempting to derive characteristics of inputs
difficult for summarization, we first confirm that in-
deed expected performance is influenced by the in-
put itself. We performed analysis of variance for
DUC 2001 data, with automatic system coverage
score as the dependent variable, to gain some insight
into the factors related to summarization difficulty.
The results of the ANOVA with input set, summa-
rizer identity and summary length as factors, as well
as the interaction between these, are shown in Ta-
ble 1.

As expected, summarizer identity is a significant
factor: some summarization strategies/systems are
more effective than others and produce summaries
with higher coverage score. More interestingly, the
input set and summary length factors are also highly
significant and explain more of the variability in
coverage scores than summarizer identity does, as
indicated by the larger values of the F statistic.

Length The average automatic summarizer cov-
erage scores increase steadily as length requirements
are relaxed, going up from 0.50 for 50-word sum-
maries to 0.76 for 400-word summaries as shown in
Table 2 (second row). The general trend we observe
is that on average systems are better at producing
summaries when more space is available. The dif-

1The routinely used tool for automatic evaluation ROUGE
was adopted exactly because it was demonstrated it is highly
correlated with the manual DUC coverage scores (Lin and
Hovy, 2003a; Lin, 2004).

Human 1.00 1.17 1.38 1.29
Automatic 0.50 0.55 0.70 0.76
Baseline 0.41 0.46 0.52 0.57

ferences are statistically significant2 only between
50-word and 200- and 400-word summaries and be-
tween 100-word and 400-word summaries. The fact
that summary quality improves with increasing sum-
mary length has been observed in prior studies as
well (Radev and Tam, 2003; Lin and Hovy, 2003b;
Kolluru and Gotoh, 2005) but generally little atten-
tion has been paid to this fact in system development
and no specific user studies are available to show
what summary length might be most suitable for
specific applications. In later editions of the DUC
conference, only summaries of 100 words were pro-
duced, focusing development efforts on one of the
more demanding length restrictions. The interaction
between summary length and summarizer is small
but significant (Table 1), with certain summariza-
tion strategies more successful at particular sum-
mary lengths than at others.

Improved performance as measured by increase
in coverage scores is observed for human summa-
rizers as well (shown in the first row of Table 2).
Even the baseline systems (first n words of the most
recent article in the input or first sentences from
different input articles) show improvement when
longer summaries are allowed (performance shown
in the third row of the table). It is important to
notice that the difference between automatic sys-
tem and baseline performance increases as the sum-
mary length increases—the difference between sys-
tems and baselines coverage scores is around 0.1
for the shorter 50- and 100-word summaries but 0.2
for the longer summaries. This fact has favorable
implications for practical system developments be-
cause it indicates that in applications where some-
what longer summaries are appropriate, automati-
cally produced summaries will be much more infor-
mative than a baseline summary.

Table 1: Analysis of variance for coverage scores of automatic systems with input, summarizer, and length as factors.

Input The input set itself is a highly significant
factor that influences the coverage scores that sys-
tems obtain: some inputs are handled by the systems
better than others. Moreover, the input interacts both
with the summarizers and the summary length.

This is an important finding for several reasons.
First, in system evaluations such as DUC the inputs
for summarization are manually selected by anno-
tators. There is no specific attempt to ensure that
the inputs across different years have on average the
same difficulty. Simply assuming this to be the case
could be misleading: it is possible in a given year to
have “easier” input test set compared to a previous
year. Then system performance across years can-
not be meaningfully compared, and higher system
scores would not be indicative of system improve-
ment between the evaluations.

Second, in summarization applications there is
some control over the input for summarization. For
example, related documents that need to summa-
rized could be split into smaller subsets that are more
amenable to summarization or routed to an appropri-
ate summarization system than can handle this kind
of input using a different strategy, as done for in-
stance in (McKeown et al., 2002).

Because of these important implications we inves-
tigate input characteristics and define various fea-
tures distinguishing easy inputs from difficult ones.

2.2 Difficulty for people and machines

Before proceeding to the analysis of input difficulty
in multi-document summarization, it is worth men-
tioning that our study is primarily motivated by sys-
tem development needs and consequently the focus
is on finding out what inputs are easy or difficult
for automatic systems. Different factors might make
summarization difficult for people. In order to see to
what extent the notion of summarization input dif-

ficulty is shared between machines and people, we
computed the correlation between the average sys-
tem and average human coverage score at a given
summary length for all DUC 2001 test sets (shown
in Table 3). The correlation is highest for 200-word
summaries, 0.77, which is also highly significant.
For shorter summaries the correlation between hu-
man and system performance is not significant.

In the remaining part of the paper we deal ex-
clusively with difficulty as defined by system per-
formance, which differs from difficulty for people
summarizing the same material as evidenced by the
correlations in Table 3. We do not attempt to draw
conclusions about any cognitively relevant factors
involved in summarizing.

2.3 Type of summary and difficulty

In DUC 2001, annotators prepared test sets from five
possible predefined input categories:3 .

Single event (3 sets) Documents describing a single
event over a timeline (e.g. The Exxon Valdez
oil spill).

3Participants in the evaluation were aware of the different
categories of input and indeed some groups developed systems
that handled different types of input employing different strate-
gies (McKeown et al., 2001). In later years, the idea of multi-
strategy summarization has been further explored by (Lacatusu
et al., 2006)

827



Subject (6 sets) Documents discussing a single
topic (e.g. Mad cow disease)

Biographical (2 sets) All documents in the input
provide information about the same person
(e.g. Elizabeth Taylor)

Multiple distinct events (12 sets) The documents
discuss different events of the same type (e.g.
different occasions of police misconduct).

Opinion (6 sets) Each document describes a differ-
ent perspective to a common topic (e.g. views
of the senate, congress, public, lawyers etc on
the decision by the senate to count illegal aliens
in the 1990 census).

Figure 1 shows the average system coverage score
for the different input types. The more topically co-
hesive input types such as biographical, single event
and subject, which are more focused on a single en-
tity or news item and narrower in scope, are eas-
ier for systems. The average system coverage score
for them is higher than for the non-cohesive sets
such as multiple distinct events and opinion sets, re-
gardless of summary length. The difference is even
more apparently clear when the scores are plotted af-
ter grouping input types into cohesive (biographical,
single event and subject) and non-cohesive (multi-
ple events and opinion). Such grouping also gives
the necessary power to perform statistical test for
significance, confirming the difference in coverage
scores for the two groups. This is not surprising: a
summary of documents describing multiple distinct
events of the same type is likely to require higher
degree of generalization and abstraction. Summa-
rizing opinions would in addition be highly subjec-
tive. A summary of a cohesive set meanwhile would
contain facts directly from the input and it would be
easier to determine which information is important.
The example human summaries for set D32 (single
event) and set D19 (opinions) shown below give an
idea of the potential difficulties automatic summa-
rizers have to deal with. set D32 On 24 March 1989,
the oil tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground on a reef near
Valdez, Alaska, spilling 8.4 million gallons of crude oil
into Prince William Sound. In two days, the oil spread
over 100 miles with a heavy toll on wildlife. Cleanup
proceeded at a slow pace, and a plan for cleaning 364
miles of Alaskan coastline was released. In June, the
tanker was refloated. By early 1990, only 5 to 9 percent of
spilled oil was recovered. A federal jury indicted Exxon

on five criminal charges and the Valdez skipper was guilty
of negligent discharge of oil.

set D19 Congress is debating whether or not to count ille-
gal aliens in the 1990 census. Congressional House seats
are apportioned to the states and huge sums of federal
money are allocated based on census population. Cali-
fornia, with an estimated half of all illegal aliens, will be
greatly affected. Those arguing for inclusion say that the
Constitution does not mention “citizens”, but rather, in-
structs that House apportionment be based on the “whole
number of persons” residing in the various states. Those
opposed say that the framers were unaware of this issue.
“Illegal aliens” did not exist in the U.S. until restrictive
immigration laws were passed in 1875.

The manual set-type labels give an intuitive idea
of what factors might be at play but it is desirable to
devise more specific measures to predict difficulty.
Do such measures exist? Is there a way to automati-
cally distinguish cohesive (easy) from non-cohesive
(difficult) sets? In the next section we define a num-
ber of features that aim to capture the cohesiveness
of an input set and show that some of them are in-
deed significantly related to set difficulty.

3 Features

We implemented 14 features for our analysis of in-
put set difficulty. The working hypothesis is that co-
hesive sets with clear topics are easier to summarize
and the features we define are designed to capture
aspects of input cohesiveness.

Number of sentences in the input, calculated
over all articles in the input set. Shorter inputs
should be easier as there will be less information loss
between the summary and the original material.

Vocabulary size of the input set, equal to the
number of unique words in the input. Smaller vo-
cabularies would be characteristic of easier sets.

Percentage of words used only once in the input.
The rationale behind this feature is that cohesive in-
put sets contain news articles dealing with a clearly
defined topic, so words will be reused across docu-
ments. Sets that cover disparate events and opinions
are likely to contain more words that appear in the
input only once.

Type-token ratio is a measure of the lexical vari-
ation in an input set and is equal to the input vo-
cabulary size divided by the number of words in the

828



Figure 1: Average system coverage scores for summaries in a category

input. A high type-token ratio indicates there is little
(lexical) repetition in the input, a possible side-effect
of non-cohesiveness.

Entropy of the input set. Let X be a discrete ran-
dom variable taking values from the finite set V =
{w1, ..., wn} where V is the vocabulary of the in-
put set and wi are the words that appear in the input.
The probability distribution p(w) = Pr(X = w)
can be easily calculated using frequency counts from
the input. The entropy of the input set is equal to the
entropy of X:

H(X) = −
i=n
∑

i=1

p(wi) log2 p(wi) (1)

Average, minimum and maximum cosine over-
lap between the news articles in the input. Repeti-
tion in the input is often exploited as an indicator of
importance by different summarization approaches
(Luhn, 1958; Barzilay et al., 1999; Radev et al.,
2004; Nenkova et al., 2006). The more similar the
different documents in the input are to each other,
the more likely there is repetition across documents
at various granularities.

Cosine similarity between the document vector
representations is probably the easiest and most
commonly used among the various similarity mea-
sures. We use tf*idf weights in the vector represen-
tations, with term frequency (tf) normalized by the
total number of words in the document in order to re-
move bias resulting from high frequencies by virtue
of higher document length alone.

The cosine similarity between two (document
representation) vectors v1 and v2 is given by cosθ =

v1.v2
||v1||||v2||

. A value of 0 indicates that the vectors are
orthogonal and dissimilar, a value of 1 indicates per-
fectly similar documents in terms of the words con-
tained in them.

To compute the cosine overlap features, we find
the pairwise cosine similarity between each two
documents in an input set and compute their aver-
age. The minimum and maximum overlap features
are also computed as an indication of the overlap
bounds. We expect cohesive inputs to be composed
of similar documents, hence the cosine overlaps in
these sets of documents must be higher than those in
non-cohesive inputs.

KL divergence Another measure of relatedness
of the documents comprising an input set is the dif-
ference in word distributions in the input compared
to the word distribution in a large collection of di-
verse texts. If the input is found to be largely dif-
ferent from a generic collection, it is plausible to as-
sume that the input is not a random collection of ar-
ticles but rather is defined by a clear topic discussed
within and across the articles. It is reasonable to ex-
pect that the higher the divergence is, the easier it is
to define what is important in the article and hence
the easier it is to produce a good summary.

For computing the distribution of words in a gen-
eral background corpus, we used all the inputs sets
from DUC years 2001 to 2006. The divergence mea-
sure we used is the Kullback Leibler divergence, or

829



relative entropy, between the input (I) and collection
language models. Let pinp(w) be the probability of
the word w in the input and pcoll(w) be the proba-
bility of the word occurring in the large background
collection. Then the relative entropy between the in-
put and the collection is given by

KL divergence =
∑

w∈I

pinp(w) log2
pinp(w)

pcoll(w)
(2)

Low KL divergence from a random background
collection may be characteristic of highly non-
cohesive inputs consisting of unrelated documents.

Number of topic signature terms for the input
set. The idea of topic signature terms was intro-
duced by Lin and Hovy (Lin and Hovy, 2000) in the
context of single document summarization, and was
later used in several multi-document summarization
systems (Conroy et al., 2006; Lacatusu et al., 2004;
Gupta et al., 2007).

Lin and Hovy’s idea was to automatically iden-
tify words that are descriptive for a cluster of docu-
ments on the same topic, such as the input to a multi-
document summarizer. We will call this cluster T .
Since the goal is to find descriptive terms for the
cluster, a comparison collection of documents not
on the topic is also necessary (we will call this back-
ground collection NT ).

Given T and NT , the likelihood ratio statistic
(Dunning, 1994) is used to identify the topic signa-
ture terms. The probabilistic model of the data al-
lows for statistical inference in order to decide which
terms t are associated with T more strongly than
with NT than one would expect by chance.

More specifically, there are two possibilities for
the distribution of a term t: either it is very indicative
of the topic of cluster T , and appears more often in
T than in documents from NT , or the term t is not
topical and appears with equal frequency across both
T and NT . These two alternatives can be formally
written as the following hypotheses:

H1: P (t|T ) = P (t|NT ) = p (t is not a descrip-
tive term for the input)

H2: P (t|T ) = p1 and P (t|NT ) = p2 and p1 >
p2 (t is a descriptive term)

In order to compute the likelihood of each hypoth-
esis given the collection of the background docu-

ments and the topic cluster, we view them as a se-
quence of words wi: w1w2 . . . wN . The occurrence
of a given word t, wi = t, can thus be viewed a
Bernoulli trial with probability p of success, with
success occurring when wi = t and failure other-
wise.

The probability of observing the term t appearing
k times in N trials is given by the binomial distribu-
tion

b(k,N, p) =

(

N

k

)

p
k(1 − p)N−k (3)

We can now compute

λ =
Likelihood of the data given H1
Likelihood of the data given H2

(4)

which is equal to

λ =
b(ct,N, p)

b(cT ,NT , p1) ∗ b(cNT ,NNT , p2)
(5)

The maximum likelihood estimates for the proba-
bilities can be computed directly. p = ct

N
, where ct is

equal to the number of times term t appeared in the
entire corpus T+NT, and N is the number of words
in the entire corpus. Similarly, p1 =

cT
NT

, where cT
is the number of times term t occurred in T and NT
is the number of all words in T . p2 =

cNT
NNT

, where
cNT is the number of times term t occurred in NT
and NNT is the total number of words in NT.
−2logλ has a well-know distribution: χ2. Bigger

values of −2logλ indicate that the likelihood of the
data under H2 is higher, and the χ2 distribution can
be used to determine when it is significantly higher
(−2logλ exceeding 10 gives a significance level of
0.001 and is the cut-off we used).

For terms for which the computed −2logλ is
higher than 10, we can infer that they occur more
often with the topic T than in a general corpus NT ,
and we can dub them “topic signature terms”.

Percentage of signature terms in vocabulary
The number of signature terms gives the total count
of topic signatures over all the documents in the in-
put. However, the number of documents in an input
set and the size of the individual documents across
different sets are not the same. It is therefore possi-
ble that the mere count feature is biased to the length

830



and number of documents in the input set. To ac-
count for this, we add the percentage of topic words
in the vocabulary as a feature.

Average, minimum and maximum topic sig-
nature overlap between the documents in the in-
put. Cosine similarity measures the overlap between
two documents based on all the words appearing in
them. A more refined document representation can
be defined by assuming the document vectors con-
tain only the topic signature words rather than all
words. A high overlap of topic words across two
documents is indicative of shared topicality. The
average, minimum and maximum pairwise cosine
overlap between the tf*idf weighted topic signature
vectors of the two documents are used as features
for predicting input cohesiveness. If the overlap is
large, then the topic is similar across the two docu-
ments and hence their combination will yield a co-
hesive input.

4 Feature selection

Table 4 shows the results from a one-sided t-test
comparing the values of the various features for
the easy and difficult input set classes. The com-
parisons are for summary length of 100 words be-
cause in later years only such summaries were evalu-
ated. The binary easy/difficult classes were assigned
based on the average system coverage score for the
given set, with half of the sets assigned to each class.

In addition to the t-tests we also calculated Pear-
son’s correlation (shown in Table 5) between the fea-
tures and the average system coverage score for each
set. In the correlation analysis the input sets are not
classified into easy or difficult but rather the real val-
ued coverage scores are used directly. Overall, the
features that were identified by the t-test as most de-
scriptive of the differences between easy and diffi-
cult inputs were also the ones with higher correla-
tions with real-valued coverage scores.

Our expectations in defining the features are con-
firmed by the correlation results. For example, sys-
tems have low coverage scores for sets with high-
entropy vocabularies as indicated by the negative
and high by absolute value correlation (-0.4256).
Sets with high entropy are those in which there is
little repetition within and across different articles,
and for which it is subsequently difficult to deter-

skewed compared to a general collection of articles,
with important topic words occurring more often.

Easy to summarize sets are characterized by low
entropy, small vocabulary, high average cosine and

5 Classification results

We used the 192 sets from multi-document summa-
rization DUC evaluations in 2002 (55 generic sets),
2003 (30 generic summary sets and 7 viewpoint sets)
and 2004 (50 generic and 50 biography sets) to train
and test a logistic regression classifier. The sets from
all years were pooled together and evenly divided
into easy and difficult inputs based on the average
system coverage score for each set.

Table 6 shows the results from 10-fold cross val-
idation. SIG is a classifier based on the six features
identified as significant in distinguishing easy from
difficult inputs based on a t-test comparison (Ta-
ble 4). SIG+yt has two additional features: the year
and the type of summarization input (generic, view-
point and biographical). ALL is a classifier based on
all 14 features defined in the previous section, and

cases, adding the year and task leads to extra 3%
net improvement. The best overall results are for
the SIG+yt classifier with net improvement over the
baseline equal to 20%. At the same time, it should
be taken into consideration that the amount of train-
ing data for our experiments is small: a total of 192
sets. Despite this, the measures of input cohesive-
ness capture enough information to result in a clas-
sifier with above-baseline performance.

6 Conclusions

We have addressed the question of what makes the
writing of a summary for a multi-document input
difficult. Summary length is a significant factor,
with all summarizers (people, machines and base-
lines) performing better at longer summary lengths.

An exploratory analysis of DUC 2001 indicated that
systems produce better summaries for cohesive in-
puts dealing with a clear topic (single event, subject
and biographical sets) while non-cohesive sets about
multiple events and opposing opinions are consis-
tently of lower quality. We defined a number of fea-
tures aimed at capturing input cohesiveness, ranging
from simple features such as input length and size
to more sophisticated measures such as input set en-
tropy, KL divergence from a background corpus and
topic signature terms based on log-likelihood ratio.

Generally, easy to summarize sets are character-
ized by low entropy, small vocabulary, high average
cosine and average topic signature overlaps, high
KL divergence and a high percentage of the vocab-
ulary consists of topic signature terms. Experiments
with a logistic regression classifier based on the fea-
tures further confirms that input cohesiveness is pre-
dictive of the difficulty it will pose to automatic sum-
marizers.

Several important notes can be made. First, it is
important to develop strategies that can better handle
non-cohesive inputs, reducing fluctuations in sys-
tem performance. Most current systems are devel-
oped with the expectation they can handle any input
but this is evidently not the case and more attention
should be paid to the issue. Second, the interpre-
tations of year to year evaluations can be affected.
As demonstrated, the properties of the input have a
considerable influence on summarization quality. If
special care is not taken to ensure that the difficulty
of inputs in different evaluations is kept more or less
the same, results from the evaluations are not com-
parable and we cannot make general claims about
progress and system improvements between evalua-
tions. Finally, the presented results are clearly just a
beginning in understanding of summarization diffi-
culty. A more complete characterization of summa-
rization input will be necessary in the future.
