Abstract

A central problem in grounded language acqui-
sition is learning the correspondences between a
rich world state and a stream of text which refer-
ences that world state. To deal with the high de-
gree of ambiguity present in this setting, we present
a generative model that simultaneously segments
the text into utterances and maps each utterance
to a meaning representation grounded in the world
state. We show that our model generalizes across
three domains of increasing difficulty—Robocup
sportscasting, weather forecasts (a new domain),
and NFL recaps.

1 Introduction

Recent work in learning semantics has focused
on mapping sentences to meaning representa-
tions (e.g., some logical form) given aligned sen-
tence/meaning pairs as training data (Ge and
Mooney, 2005; Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005;
Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2007; Lu et al., 2008).
However, this degree of supervision is unrealistic
for modeling human language acquisition and can
be costly to obtain for building large-scale, broad-
coverage language understanding systems.

A more flexible direction is grounded language
acquisition: learning the meaning of sentences
in the context of an observed world state. The
grounded approach has gained interest in various
disciplines (Siskind, 1996; Yu and Ballard, 2004;
Feldman and Narayanan, 2004; Gorniak and Roy,
2007). Some recent work in the NLP commu-
nity has also moved in this direction by relaxing
the amount of supervision to the setting where
each sentence is paired with a small set of can-
didate meanings (Kate and Mooney, 2007; Chen
and Mooney, 2008).

The goal of this paper is to reduce the amount
of supervision even further. We assume that we are
given a world state represented by a set of records
along with a text, an unsegmented sequence of
words. For example, in the weather forecast do-
main (Section 2.2), the text is the weather report,

and the records provide a structured representation
of the temperature, sky conditions, etc.

In this less restricted data setting, we must re-
solve multiple ambiguities: (1) the segmentation
of the text into utterances; (2) the identification of
relevant facts, i.e., the choice of records and as-
pects of those records; and (3) the alignment of ut-
terances to facts (facts are the meaning represen-
tations of the utterances). Furthermore, in some
of our examples, much of the world state is not
referenced at all in the text, and, conversely, the
text references things which are not represented in
our world state. This increased amount of ambigu-
ity and noise presents serious challenges for learn-
ing. To cope with these challenges, we propose a
probabilistic generative model that treats text seg-
mentation, fact identification, and alignment in a
single unified framework. The parameters of this
hierarchical hidden semi-Markov model can be es-
timated efficiently using EM.

We tested our model on the task of aligning
text to records in three different domains. The
first domain is Robocup sportscasting (Chen and
Mooney, 2008). Their best approach (KRISPER)
obtains 67% F1; our method achieves 76.5%. This
domain is simplified in that the segmentation is
known. The second domain is weather forecasts,
for which we created a new dataset. Here, the
full complexity of joint segmentation and align-
ment arises. Nonetheless, we were able to obtain
reasonable results on this task. The third domain
we considered is NFL recaps (Barzilay and Lap-
ata, 2005; Snyder and Barzilay, 2007). The lan-
guage used in this domain is richer by orders of
magnitude, and much of it does not reference the
world state. Nonetheless, taking the first unsuper-
vised approach to this problem, we were able to
make substantial progress: We achieve an F1 of
53.2%, which closes over half of the gap between
a heuristic baseline (26%) and supervised systems
(68%–80%).

2 Domains and Datasets

Our goal is to learn the correspondence between a
text w and the world state s it describes. We use
the term scenario to refer to such a (w, s) pair.

The text is simply a sequence of words w =
(w1, . . . , w|w|). We represent the world state s as
a set of records, where each record r ∈ s is de-
scribed by a record type r.t ∈ T and a tuple of
field values r.v = (r.v1, . . . , r.vm).1 For exam-
ple, temperature is a record type in the weather
domain, and it has four fields: time, min, mean,
and max.

The record type r.t ∈ T specifies the field type
r.tf ∈ {INT, STR, CAT} of each field value r.vf ,
f = 1, . . . ,m. There are three possible field
types—integer (INT), string (STR), and categori-
cal (CAT)—which are assumed to be known and
fixed. Integer fields represent numeric properties
of the world such as temperature, string fields rep-
resent surface-level identifiers such as names of
people, and categorical fields represent discrete
concepts such as score types in football (touch-
down, field goal, and safety). The field type de-
termines the way we expect the field value to be
rendered in words: integer fields can be numeri-
cally perturbed, string fields can be spliced, and
categorical fields are represented by open-ended
word distributions, which are to be learned. See
Section 3.3 for details.

2.1 Robocup Sportscasting

In this domain, a Robocup simulator generates the
state of a soccer game, which is represented by
a set of event records. For example, the record
pass(arg1=pink1,arg2=pink5) denotes a pass-
ing event; this type of record has two fields: arg1
(the actor) and arg2 (the recipient). As the game is
progressing, humans interject commentaries about
notable events in the game, e.g., pink1 passes back
to pink5 near the middle of the field. All of the

1To simplify notation, we assume that each record has m
fields, though in practice, m depends on the record type r.t.

fields in this domain are categorical, which means
there is no a priori association between the field
value pink1 and the word pink1. This degree of
flexibility is desirable because pink1 is sometimes
referred to as pink goalie, a mapping which does
not arise from string operations but must instead
be learned.

We used the dataset created by Chen and
Mooney (2008), which contains 1919 scenarios
from the 2001–2004 Robocup finals. Each sce-
nario consists of a single sentence representing a
fragment of a commentary on the game, paired
with a set of candidate records. In the annotation,
each sentence corresponds to at most one record
(possibly one not in the candidate set, in which
case we automatically get that sentence wrong).
See Figure 1(a) for an example and Table 1 for
summary statistics on the dataset.

2.2 Weather Forecasts

In this domain, the world state contains de-
tailed information about a local weather forecast
and the text is a short forecast report (see Fig-
ure 1(b) for an example). To create the dataset,
we collected local weather forecasts for 3,753
cities in the US (those with population at least
10,000) over three days (February 7–9, 2009) from
www.weather.gov. For each city and date, we
created two scenarios, one for the day forecast and
one for the night forecast. The forecasts consist of
hour-by-hour measurements of temperature, wind
speed, sky cover, chance of rain, etc., which rep-
resent the underlying world state.

This world state is summarized by records
which aggregate measurements over selected time
intervals. For example, one of the records states
the minimum, average, and maximum tempera-
ture from 5pm to 6am. This aggregation pro-
cess produced 22,146 scenarios, each containing
|s| = 36 multi-field records. There are 12 record
types, each consisting of only integer and categor-
ical fields.

To annotate the data, we split the text by punc-
tuation into lines and labeled each line with the
records to which the line refers. These lines are
used only for evaluation and are not part of the
model (see Section 5.1 for further discussion).

The weather domain is more complex than the
Robocup domain in several ways: The text w is
longer, there are more candidate records, and most
notably, w references multiple records (5.8 on av-

erage), so the segmentation of w is unknown. See
Table 1 for a comparison of the two datasets.

2.3 NFL Recaps

In this domain, each scenario represents a single
NFL football game (see Figure 1(c) for an exam-
ple). The world state (the things that happened
during the game) is represented by database tables,
e.g., scoring summary, team comparison, drive
chart, play-by-play, etc. Each record is a database
entry, for instance, the receiving statistics for a cer-
tain player. The text is the recap of the game—
an article summarizing the game highlights. The
dataset we used was collected by Barzilay and La-
pata (2005). The data includes 466 games during
the 2003–2004 NFL season. 78 of these games
were annotated by Snyder and Barzilay (2007),
who aligned each sentence to a set of records.

This domain is by far the most complicated of
the three. Many records corresponding to inconse-
quential game statistics are not mentioned. Con-
versely, the text contains many general remarks
(e.g., it was just that type of game) which are
not present in any of the records. Furthermore,
the complexity of the language used in the re-
cap is far greater than what we can represent us-

ing our simple model. Fortunately, most of the
fields are integer fields or string fields (generally
names or brief descriptions), which provide im-
portant anchor points for learning the correspon-
dences. Nonetheless, the same names and num-
bers occur in multiple records, so there is still un-
certainty about which record is referenced by a
given sentence.

3 Generative Model

To learn the correspondence between a text w and
a world state s, we propose a generative model
p(w | s) with latent variables specifying this cor-
respondence.

Our model combines segmentation with align-
ment. The segmentation aspect of our model is
similar to that of Grenager et al. (2005) and Eisen-
stein and Barzilay (2008), but in those two models,
the segments are clustered into topics rather than
grounded to a world state. The alignment aspect
of our model is similar to the HMM model for
word alignment (Ney and Vogel, 1996). DeNero
et al. (2008) perform joint segmentation and word
alignment for machine translation, but the nature
of that task is different from ours.

The model is defined by a generative process,

93



which proceeds in three stages (Figure 2 shows the
corresponding graphical model):

1. Record choice: choose a sequence of records
r = (r1, . . . , r|r|) to describe, where each
ri ∈ s.

2. Field choice: for each chosen record ri, se-
lect a sequence of fields fi = (fi1, . . . , fi|fi|),
where each fij ∈ {1, . . . ,m}.

3. Word choice: for each chosen field fij ,
choose a number cij > 0 and generate a se-
quence of cij words.

The observed text w is the terminal yield formed
by concatenating the sequences of words of all
fields generated; note that the segmentation of w
provided by c = {cij} is latent. Think of the
words spanned by a record as constituting an ut-
terance with a meaning representation given by the
record and subset of fields chosen.

Formally, our probabilistic model places a dis-
tribution over (r, f , c,w) and factorizes according
to the three stages as follows:

p(r, f , c,w | s) = p(r | s)p(f | r)p(c,w | r, f , s)

The following three sections describe each of
these stages in more detail.

3.1 Record Choice Model
The record choice model specifies a distribu-
tion over an ordered sequence of records r =
(r1, . . . , r|r|), where each record ri ∈ s. This
model is intended to capture two types of regu-
larities in the discourse structure of language. The
first is salience, that is, some record types are sim-
ply more prominent than others. For example, in
the NFL domain, 70% of scoring records are men-
tioned whereas only 1% of punting records are
mentioned. The second is the idea of local co-
herence, that is, the order in which one mentions
records tend to follow certain patterns. For ex-
ample, in the weather domain, the sky conditions
are generally mentioned first, followed by temper-
ature, and then wind speed.

To capture these two phenomena, we define a
Markov model on the record types (and given the
record type, a record is chosen uniformly from the
set of records with that type):

p(r | s) =
|r|∏
i=1

p(ri.t | ri−1.t)
1

|s(ri.t)|
, (1)

where s(t)
def
= {r ∈ s : r.t = t} and r0.t is

a dedicated START record type.2 We also model
the transition of the final record type to a desig-
nated STOP record type in order to capture regu-
larities about the types of records which are de-
scribed last. More sophisticated models of coher-
ence could also be employed here (Barzilay and
Lapata, 2008).

We assume that s includes a special null record
whose type is NULL, responsible for generating
parts of our text which do not refer to any real
records.

3.2 Field Choice Model

Each record type t ∈ T has a separate field choice
model, which specifies a distribution over a se-
quence of fields. We want to capture salience
and coherence at the field level like we did at the
record level. For instance, in the weather domain,
the minimum and maximum fields of a tempera-
ture record are mentioned whereas the average is
not. In the Robocup domain, the actor typically
precedes the recipient in passing event records.

Formally, we have a Markov model over the
fields:3

p(f | r) =
|r|∏
i=1

|fj |∏
j=1

p(fij | fi(j−1)). (2)

Each record type has a dedicated null field with
its own multinomial distribution over words, in-
tended to model words which refer to that record
type in general (e.g., the word passes for passing
records). We also model transitions into the first
field and transitions out of the final field with spe-
cial START and STOP fields. This Markov structure
allows us to capture a few elements of rudimentary
syntax.

3.3 Word Choice Model

We arrive at the final component of our model,
which governs how the information about a par-
ticular field of a record is rendered into words. For
each field fij , we generate the number of words cij
from a uniform distribution over {1, 2, . . . , Cmax},
where Cmax is set larger than the length of the
longest text we expect to see. Conditioned on

2We constrain our inference to only consider record types
t that occur in s, i.e., s(t) 6= ∅.

3During inference, we prohibit consecutive fields from re-
peating.

Figure 2: Graphical model representing the generative model. First, records are chosen and ordered from the set s. Then fields
are chosen for each record. Finally, words are chosen for each field. The world state s and the words w are observed, while
(r, f , c) are latent variables to be inferred (note that the number of latent variables itself is unknown).

the fields f , the words w are generated indepen-
dently:4

p(w | r, f , c, s) =
|w|∏
k=1

pw(wk | r(k).tf(k), r(k).vf(k)),

where r(k) and f(k) are the record and field re-
sponsible for generating word wk, as determined
by the segmentation c. The word choice model
pw(w | t, v) specifies a distribution over words
given the field type t and field value v. This distri-
bution is a mixture of a global backoff distribution
over words and a field-specific distribution which
depends on the field type t.

Although we designed our word choice model
to be relatively general, it is undoubtedly influ-
enced by the three domains. However, we can
readily extend or replace it with an alternative if
desired; this modularity is one principal benefit of
probabilistic modeling.

Integer Fields (t = INT) For integer fields, we
want to capture the intuition that a numeric quan-
tity v is rendered in the text as a word which
is possibly some other numerical value w due to
stylistic factors. Sometimes the exact value v is
used (e.g., in reporting football statistics). Other
times, it might be customary to round v (e.g., wind
speeds are typically rounded to a multiple of 5).
In other cases, there might just be some unex-
plained error, where w deviates from v by some
noise �+ = w − v > 0 or �− = v − w > 0. We
model �+ and �− as geometric distributions.5 In

4While a more sophisticated model of words would be
useful if we intended to use this model for natural language
generation, the false independence assumptions present here
matter less for the task of learning the semantic correspon-
dences because we always condition on w.

5Specifically, p(�+;α+) = (1 − α+)�+−1α+, where
α+ is a field-specific parameter; p(�−;α−) is defined analo-
gously.

Figure 3: Two integer field types in the weather domain for
which we learn different distributions over the ways in which
a value v might appear in the text as a word w. Suppose the
record field value is v = 13. Both distributions are centered
around v, as is to be expected, but the two distributions have
different shapes: For temperature.min, almost all the mass
is to the left, suggesting that forecasters tend to report con-
servative lower bounds. For the wind speed, the mass is con-
centrated on 13 and 15, suggesting that forecasters frequently
round wind speeds to multiples of 5.

summary, we allow six possible ways of generat-
ing the word w given v:

v dve5 bvc5 round5(v) v − �− v + �+

Separate probabilities for choosing among these
possibilities are learned for each field type (see
Figure 3 for an example).

String Fields (t = STR) Strings fields are in-
tended to represent values which we expect to be
realized in the text via a simple surface-level trans-
formation. For example, a name field with value
v = Moe Williams is sometimes referenced in the
text by just Williams. We used a simple generic
model of rendering string fields: Let w be a word
chosen uniformly from those in v.

Categorical Fields (t = CAT) Unlike string
fields, categorical fields are not tied down to any
lexical representation; in fact, the identities of the
categorical field values are irrelevant. For each
categorical field f and possible value v, we have a

separate multinomial distribution over words from
which w is drawn. An example of a categori-
cal field is skyCover.mode in the weather domain,
which has four values: 0-25, 25-50, 50-75,
and 75-100. Table 2 shows the top words for
each of these field values learned by our model.

4 Learning and Inference

Our learning and inference methodology is a fairly
conventional application of Expectation Maxi-
mization (EM) and dynamic programming. The
input is a set of scenarios D, each of which is a
text w paired with a world state s. We maximize
the marginal likelihood of our data, summing out
the latent variables (r, f , c):

max
θ

∏
(w,s)∈D

∑
r,f ,c

p(r, f , c,w | s; θ), (3)

where θ are the parameters of the model (all the
multinomial probabilities). We use the EM algo-
rithm to maximize (3), which alternates between
the E-step and the M-step. In the E-step, we
compute expected counts according to the poste-
rior p(r, f , c | w, s; θ). In the M-step, we op-
timize the parameters θ by normalizing the ex-
pected counts computed in the E-step. In our ex-
periments, we initialized EM with a uniform dis-
tribution for each multinomial and applied add-0.1
smoothing to each multinomial in the M-step.

As with most complex discrete models, the bulk
of the work is in computing expected counts under
p(r, f , c | w, s; θ). Formally, our model is a hier-
archical hidden semi-Markov model conditioned
on s. Inference in the E-step can be done using a
dynamic program similar to the inside-outside al-
gorithm.

5 Experiments

Two important aspects of our model are the seg-
mentation of the text and the modeling of the co-

herence structure at both the record and field lev-
els. To quantify the benefits of incorporating these
two aspects, we compare our full model with two
simpler variants.

• Model 1 (no model of segmentation or co-
herence): Each record is chosen indepen-
dently; each record generates one field, and
each field generates one word. This model is
similar in spirit to IBM model 1 (Brown et
al., 1993).

• Model 2 (models segmentation but not coher-
ence): Records and fields are still generated
independently, but each field can now gener-
ate multiple words.

• Model 3 (our full model of segmentation and
coherence): Records and fields are generated
according to the Markov chains described in
Section 3.

5.1 Evaluation

In the annotated data, each text w has been di-
vided into a set of lines. These lines correspond
to clauses in the weather domain and sentences in
the Robocup and NFL domains. Each line is an-
notated with a (possibly empty) set of records. Let
A be the gold set of these line-record alignment
pairs.

To evaluate a learned model, we com-
pute the Viterbi segmentation and alignment
(argmaxr,f ,c p(r, f , c | w, s)). We produce a pre-
dicted set of line-record pairsA′ by aligning a line
to a record ri if the span of (the utterance corre-
sponding to) ri overlaps the line. The reason we
evaluate indirectly using lines rather than using ut-
terances is that it is difficult to annotate the seg-
mentation of text into utterances in a simple and
consistent manner.

We compute standard precision, recall, and F1
of A′ with respect to A. Unless otherwise spec-
ified, performance is reported on all scenarios,
which were also used for training. However, we
did not tune any hyperparameters, but rather used
generic values which worked well enough across
all three domains.

5.2 Robocup Sportscasting

We ran 10 iterations of EM on Models 1–3. Ta-
ble 3 shows that performance improves with in-
creased model sophistication. We also compare

our model to the results of Chen and Mooney
(2008) in Table 4.

Figure 4 provides a closer look at the predic-
tions made by each of our three models for a par-
ticular example. Model 1 easily mistakes pink10
for the recipient of a pass record because decisions
are made independently for each word. Model 2
chooses the correct record, but having no model
of the field structure inside a record, it proposes
an incorrect field segmentation (although our eval-
uation is insensitive to this). Equipped with the
ability to prefer a coherent field sequence, Model
3 fixes these errors.

Many of the remaining errors are due to the
garbage collection phenomenon familiar from
word alignment models (Moore, 2004; Liang et
al., 2006). For example, the ballstopped record
occurs frequently but is never mentioned in the
text. At the same time, there is a correlation be-
tween ballstopped and utterances such as pink2
holds onto the ball, which are not aligned to any
record in the annotation. As a result, our model
incorrectly chooses to align the two.

5.3 Weather Forecasts

For the weather domain, staged training was nec-
essary to get good results. For Model 1, we ran
15 iterations of EM. For Model 2, we ran 5 it-
erations of EM on Model 1, followed by 10 it-
erations on Model 2. For Model 3, we ran 5 it-
erations of Model 1, 5 iterations of a simplified
variant of Model 3 where records were chosen in-
dependently, and finally, 5 iterations of Model 3.
When going from one model to another, we used
the final posterior distributions of the former to ini-

hibited utterances in Models 2 and 3 from crossing
punctuation during inference.

Table 5 shows that performance improves sub-
stantially in the more sophisticated models, the
gains being greater than in the Robocup domain.
Figure 5 shows the predictions of the three models
on an example. Model 1 is only able to form iso-
lated (but not completely inaccurate) associations.
By modeling segmentation, Model 2 accounts for
the intermediate words, but errors are still made
due to the lack of Markov structure. Model 3
remedies this. However, unexpected structures
are sometimes learned. For example, the temper-
ature.time=6-21 field indicates daytime, which
happens to be perfectly correlated with the word
high, although high intuitively should be associ-
ated with the temperature.max field. In these cases
of high correlation (Table 2 provides another ex-
ample), it is very difficult to recover the proper
alignment without additional supervision.

5.4 NFL Recaps

In order to scale up our models to the NFL do-
main, we first pruned for each sentence the records
which have either no numerical values (e.g., 23,
23-10, 2/4) nor name-like words (e.g., those that
appear only capitalized in the text) in common.
This eliminated all but 1.5% of the record can-
didates per sentence, while maintaining an ora-

6It is interesting to note that this type of staged training
is evocative of language acquisition in children: lexical asso-
ciations are formed (Model 1) before higher-level discourse
structure is learned (Model 3).

cle alignment F1 score of 88.7. Guessing a single
random record for each sentence yields an F1 of
12.0. A reasonable heuristic which uses weighted
number- and string-matching achieves 26.7.

Due to the much greater complexity of this do-
main, Model 2 was easily misled as it tried with-
out success to find a coherent segmentation of the
fields. We therefore created a variant, Model 2’,
where we constrained each field to generate ex-
actly one word. To train Model 2’, we ran 5 it-
erations of EM where each sentence is assumed
to have exactly one record, followed by 5 itera-
tions where the constraint was relaxed to also al-
low record boundaries at punctuation and the word
and. We did not experiment with Model 3 since
the discourse structure on records in this domain is
not at all governed by a simple Markov model on
record types—indeed, most regions do not refer to
any records at all. We also fixed the backoff prob-
ability to 0.1 instead of learning it and enforced
zero numerical deviation on integer field values.

Model 2’ achieved an F1 of 39.9, an improve-
ment over Model 1, which attained 32.8. Inspec-
tion of the errors revealed the following problem:
The alignment task requires us to sometimes align
a sentence to multiple redundant records (e.g.,
play and score) referenced by the same part of the
text. However, our model generates each part of
text from only one record, and thus it can only al-
low an alignment to one record.7 To cope with this
incompatibility between the data and our notion of
semantics, we used the following solution: We di-
vided the records into three groups by type: play,
score, and other. Each group has a copy of the
model, but we enforce that they share the same
segmentation. We also introduce a potential that
couples the presence or absence of records across

7The model can align a sentence to multiple records pro-
vided that the records are referenced by non-overlapping
parts of the text.

groups on the same segment to capture regular co-
occurrences between redundant records.

Table 6 shows our results. With groups, we
achieve an F1 of 53.2. Though we still trail su-
pervised techniques, which attain numbers in the
68–80 range, we have made substantial progress
over our baseline using an unsupervised method.
Furthermore, our model provides a more detailed
analysis of the correspondence between the world
state and text, rather than just producing a single
alignment decision. Most of the remaining errors
made by our model are due to a lack of calibra-
tion. Sometimes, our false positives are close calls
where a sentence indirectly references a record,
and our model predicts the alignment whereas the
annotation standard does not. We believe that fur-
ther progress is possible with a richer model.

6 Conclusion

We have presented a generative model of corre-
spondences between a world state and an unseg-
mented stream of text. By having a joint model
of salience, coherence, and segmentation, as well
as a detailed rendering of the values in the world
state into words in the text, we are able to cope
with the increased ambiguity that arises in this new
data setting, successfully pushing the limits of un-
supervision.
