Abstract 

The abundance of homophones in Chinese 

significantly increases the number of similarly 

acceptable candidates in English-to-Chinese 

transliteration (E2C).  The dialectal factor also 

leads to different transliteration practice.  We 

compare E2C between Mandarin Chinese and 

Cantonese, and report work in progress for 

dealing with homophones and tonal patterns 

despite potential skewed distributions of indi-

vidual Chinese characters in the training data.  

1 Introduction 

This paper addresses the problem of automatic 

English-Chinese forward transliteration (referred 

to as E2C hereafter). 

There are only a few hundred Chinese charac-

ters commonly used in names, but their combina-

tion is relatively free.  Such flexibility, however, 

is not entirely ungoverned.  For instance, while 

the Brazilian striker Ronaldo is rendered as朗拿

度  long5-naa4-dou6 in Cantonese, other pho-

netically similar candidates like 朗娜度 long5-

naa4-dou6 or 郎拿刀 long4-naa4-dou1

 are least 

likely.  Beyond linguistic and phonetic properties, 

many other social and cognitive factors such as 

dialect, gender, domain, meaning, and perception, 

are simultaneously influencing the naming proc-

ess and superimposing on the surface graphemic 

correspondence. 

The abundance of homophones in Chinese fur-

ther complicates the problem.  Past studies on 

phoneme-based E2C have reported their adverse 

effects (e.g. Virga and Khudanpur, 2003).  Direct 

orthographic mapping (e.g. Li et al., 2004), mak-

ing use of individual Chinese graphemes, tends

 Mandarin names are transcribed in Hanyu Pinyin 

and Cantonese names are transcribed in Jyutping pub-

lished by the Linguistic Society of Hong Kong. 

to overcome the problem and model the charac-

ter choice directly.  Meanwhile, Chinese is a 

typical tonal language and the tone information 

can help distinguish certain homophones.  Pho-

neme mapping studies seldom make use of tone 

information.  Transliteration is also an open 

problem, as new names come up everyday and 

there is no absolute or one-to-one transliterated 

version for any name.  Although direct ortho-

graphic mapping has implicitly or partially mod-

elled the tone information via individual charac-

ters, the model nevertheless heavily depends on 

the availability of training data and could be 

skewed by the distribution of a certain homo-

phone and thus precludes an acceptable translit-

eration alternative.  We therefore propose to 

model the sound and tone together in E2C.  In 

this way we attempt to deal with homophones 

more reasonably especially when the training 

data is limited.  In this paper we report some 

work in progress and compare E2C in Cantonese 

and Mandarin Chinese. 

Related work will be briefly reviewed in Sec-

tion 2.  Some characteristics of E2C will be dis-

cussed in Section 3.  Work in progress will be 

reported in Section 4, followed by a conclusion 

with future work in Section 5. 

2 Related Work 

There are basically two categories of work on 

machine transliteration.  First, various alignment 

models are used for acquiring transliteration 

lexicons from parallel corpora and other re-

sources (e.g. Kuo and Li, 2008).  Second, statis-

tical models are built for transliteration.  These 

models could be phoneme-based (e.g. Knight and 

Graehl, 1998), grapheme-based (e.g. Li et al., 

2004), hybrid (Oh and Choi, 2005), or based on 

phonetic (e.g. Tao et al., 2006) and semantic (e.g. 

Li et al., 2007) features. 

Li et al. (2004) used a Joint Source-Channel 

Model under the direct orthographic mapping 

21



(DOM) framework, skipping the middle phone-

mic representation in conventional phoneme-

based methods, and modelling the segmentation 

and alignment preferences by means of contex-

tual n-grams of the transliteration units.  Al-

though DOM has implicitly modelled the tone 

choice, since a specific character has a specific 

tone, it nevertheless heavily relies on the avail-

ability of training data.  If there happens to be a 

skewed distribution of a certain Chinese charac-

ter, the model might preclude other acceptable 

transliteration alternatives.  In view of the abun-

dance of homophones in Chinese, and that 

sound-tone combination is important in names 

(i.e., names which sound “nice” are preferred to 

those which sound “monotonous”), we propose 

to model sound-tone combinations in translitera-

tion more explicitly, using pinyin transcriptions 

to bridge the graphemic representation between 

English and Chinese.  In addition, we also study 

the dialectal differences between transliteration 

in Mandarin Chinese and Cantonese, which is 

seldom addressed in past studies. 

3 Some E2C Properties 

3.1 Dialectal Differences 

English and Chinese have very different phono-

logical properties.  A well cited example is a syl-

lable initial /d/ may surface as in Baghdad 巴格

達 ba1-ge2-da2, but the syllable final /d/ is not 

represented.  This is true for Mandarin Chinese, 

but since ending stops like –p, –t and –k are al-

lowed in Cantonese syllables, the syllable final 

/d/ in Baghdad is already captured in the last syl-

lable of巴格達 baa1-gaak3-daat6 in Cantonese. 

Such phonological difference between Manda-

rin Chinese and Cantonese might also account 

for the observation that Cantonese translitera-

tions often do not introduce extra syllables for 

certain consonant segments in the middle of an 

English name, as in Dickson, transliterated as迪

克遜 di2-ke4-xun4 in Mandarin Chinese and 迪

臣 dik6-san4 in Cantonese. 

3.2 Ambiguities from Homophones 

The homophone problem is notorious in Chinese.  

As far as personal names are concerned, the 

“correctness” of transliteration is not clear-cut at 

all.  For example, to transliterate the name Hilary 

into Chinese, based on Cantonese pronunciations, 

the following are possibilities amongst many 

others: (a) 希拉利 hei1-laai1-lei6, (b) 希拉莉 

hei1-laai1-lei6, and (c) 希拉里 hei1-laai1-lei5. 

The homophonous third character gives rise to 

multiple alternative transliterations in this exam-

ple, where orthographically 利 lei6, 莉 lei6 and 

里 lei5 are observed for “ry” in transliteration 

data.  One cannot really say any of the combina-

tions is “right” or “wrong”, but perhaps only 

“better” or “worse”.  Such judgement is more 

cognitive than linguistic in nature, and appar-

ently the tonal patterns play an important role in 

this regard.  Hence naming is more of an art than 

a science, and automatic transliteration should 

avoid over-reliance on the training data and thus 

missing unlikely but good candidates. 

4 Work in Progress 

4.1 Datasets 

A common set of 1,423 source English names 

and their transliterations
2
 in Mandarin Chinese 

(as used by media in Mainland China) and Can-

tonese (as used by media in Hong Kong) were 

collected over the Internet.  The names are 

mostly from soccer, entertainment, and politics.  

The data size is admittedly small compared to 

other existing transliteration datasets, but as a 

preliminary study, we aim at comparing the 

transliteration practice between Mandarin speak-

ers and Cantonese speakers in a more objective 

way based on a common set of English names.  

The transliteration pairs were manually aligned, 

and the pronunciations for the Chinese characters 

were automatically looked up. 

4.2 Preliminary Quantitative Analysis 

 Cantonese Mandarin 

Unique name pairs 1,531 1,543 

Total English segments 4,186 4,667 

Unique English segments 969 727 

Unique grapheme pairs 1,618 1,193 

Unique seg-sound pairs 1,574 1,141 

Table 1. Quantitative Aspects of the Data 

 

As shown in Table 1, the average segment-name 

ratios (2.73 for Cantonese and 3.02 for Mandarin) 

suggest that Mandarin transliterations often use 

more syllables for a name.  The much smaller 

number of unique English segments for Manda-

rin and the difference in token-type ratio of 

grapheme pairs (3.91 for Mandarin and 2.59 for 

Cantonese) further suggest that names are more 

consistently segmented and transliterated in 

Mandarin.

 Some names have more than one transliteration.

4.2.1 Graphemic Correspondence 

Assume grapheme pair mappings are in the form 

<ek, {ck1,ck2,…,ckn}>, where ek stands for the kth 

unique English segment from the data, and 

{ck1,ck2,…,ckn} for the set of n unique Chinese 

segments observed for it.  It was found that n 

varies from 1 to 10 for Mandarin, with 34.9% of 

the distinct English segments having multiple 

grapheme mappings, as shown in Table 2.  For 

Cantonese, n varies from 1 to 13, with 31.5% of 

the distinct English segments having multiple 

grapheme mappings.  The proportion of multiple 

mappings is similar for Mandarin and Cantonese, 

but the latter has a higher percentage of English 

segments with 5 or more Chinese renditions.  

Thus Mandarin transliterations are relatively 

more “standardised”, whereas Cantonese trans-

literations are graphemically more ambiguous.

>=5 5.3% 3.3% 

4 4.0% 4.4% 

3 6.2% 7.2% 

2 16.0% 20.0% 

1 68.5% 65.1% 

Example <le, {列, 利, 勒, 尼, 

李, 歷, 烈, 爾, 理, 

萊, 路, 里, 雷}> 

<le, {列, 利, 勒,  歷, 

爾, 理, 萊, 裏, 路, 

雷}> 

Table 2. Graphemic Ambiguity of the Data 

4.2.2 Homophone Ambiguity (Sound Only) 

Table 3 shows the situation with homophones 

(ignoring tones).  For example, all five characters

利莉李里理 correspond to the Jyutping lei.  De-

spite the tone difference, they are considered 

homophones in this section. 

 
n Cantonese Mandarin 

>=5 3.3% 1.9% 

4 4.0% 2.5% 

3 5.8% 5.7% 

2 16.3% 20.7% 

1 70.5% 69.2% 

Example <le, {ji, laak, lei, 

leoi, lik, lit, loi, lou, 

nei}> 

<le, {er, lai, le, lei, 

li, lie, lu}> 

Table 3. Homophone Ambiguity (Ignoring Tone) 
 

Assume grapheme-sound pair mappings are in 

the form <ek, {sk1,sk2,…,skn}>, where ek stands for 

the kth unique English segment, and 

{sk1,sk2,…,skn} for the set of n unique pronuncia-

tions (regardless of tone).  For Mandarin, n var-

ies from 1 to 7, with 30.8% of the distinct Eng-

lish segments having multiple sound mappings.  

For Cantonese, n varies from 1 to 9, with 29.5% 

of the distinct English segments having multiple 

sound mappings.  Comparing with Table 2 above, 

the downward shift of the percentages suggests 

that much of the graphemic ambiguity is a result 

of the use of homophones, instead of a set of 

characters with very different pronunciations. 

4.2.3 Homophone Ambiguity (Sound-Tone) 

Table 4 shows the situation of homophones with 

both sound and tone taken into account.  For ex-

ample, the characters 利莉 all correspond to lei6 

in Cantonese, while 李里理  all correspond to 

lei5, and they are thus treated as two groups. 

Assume grapheme-sound/tone pair mappings 

are in the form <ek, {stk1,stk2,…,stkn}>, where ek 

stands for the kth unique English segment, and 

{stk1,stk2,…,stkn} for the set of n unique pronun-

ciations (sound-tone combination).  For Manda-

rin, n varies from 1 to 8, with 33.5% of the dis-

tinct English segments corresponding to multiple 

Chinese homophones.  For Cantonese, n varies 

from 1 to 10, with 30.8% of the distinct English 

segments having multiple Chinese homophones.  

 
n Cantonese Mandarin 

>=5 4.1% 2.8% 

4 4.8% 3.3% 

3 6.1% 6.8% 

2 15.8% 20.7% 

1 69.2% 66.5% 

Example <le, {ji5, laak6, lei5, 

lei6, leoi4, lik6, lit6, 

loi4, lou6, nei4}> 

<le, {er3, lai2, le4, 

lei2, li3, li4, lie4, 

lu4} 

Table 4. Homophone Ambiguity (Sound-Tone) 

 

The figures in Table 4 are somewhere between 

those in Table 2 and Table 3, suggesting that a 

considerable part of homophones used in the 

transliterations could be distinguished by tones.  

This supports our proposal of modelling tonal 

combination explicitly in E2C. 

4.3 Method and Experiment 

The Joint Source-Channel Model in Li et al. 

(2004) was adopted in this study.  However, in-

stead of direct orthographic mapping, we model 

the mapping between an English segment and the 

pronunciation in Chinese.  Such a model is ex-

pected to have a more compact parameter space 

as individual Chinese characters for a certain 

English segment are condensed into homophones 

defined by a finite set of sounds and tones.  The 

model could save on computational effort, and is 

less affected by any bias or sparseness of the data.  

We refer to this approach as SoTo hereafter. 

Hence our approach with a bigram model is as 

follows:

where E refers to the English source name and 

ST refers to the sound/tone sequence of the trans-

literation, while ek and stk refer to kth segment 

and its Chinese sound respectively.  Homo-

phones in Chinese are thus captured as a class in 

the phonetic transcription.  For example, the ex-

pected Cantonese transliteration for Osborne is 

奧斯邦尼  ou3-si1-bong1-nei4.  Not only is it 

ranked first using this method, its homophonous 

variant 奧施邦尼 is within the top 5, thus bene-

fitting from the grouping of the homophones, 

despite the relatively low frequency of <s,施>.  

This would be particularly useful for translitera-

tion extraction and information retrieval. 

Unlike pure phonemic modelling, the tonal 

factor is modelled in the pronunciation transcrip-

tion.  We do not go for phonemic representation 

from the source name as the transliteration of 

foreign names into Chinese is often based on the 

surface orthographic forms, e.g. the silent h in 

Beckham is pronounced to give 漢姆 han4-mu3 

in Mandarin and 咸 haam4 in Cantonese. 

Five sets of 50 test names were randomly ex-

tracted from the 1.4K names mentioned above 

for 5-fold cross validation.  Training was done 

on the remaining data.  Results were also com-

pared with DOM.  The Mean Reciprocal Rank 

(MRR) was used for evaluation (Kantor and 

Voorhees, 2000). 

4.4 Preliminary Results 

Method Cantonese Mandarin 

DOM 0.2292 0.3518 

SoTo 0.2442 0.3557 

Table 5. Average System Performance 
 

Table 5 shows the average results of the two 

methods.  The figures are relatively low com-

pared to state-of-the-art performance, largely due 

to the small datasets.  Errors might have started 

to propagate as early as the name segmentation 

step.  As a preliminary study, however, the po-

tential of the SoTo method is apparent, particu-

larly for Cantonese.  A smaller model thus per-

forms better, and treating homophones as a class 

could avoid over-reliance on the prior distribu-

tion of individual characters.  The better per-

formance for Mandarin data is not surprising 

given the less “standardised” Cantonese translit-

erations as discussed above.  From the research 

point of view, it suggests more should be consid-

ered in addition to grapheme mapping for han-

dling Cantonese data. 

5 Future Work and Conclusion 

Thus we have compared E2C between Mandarin 

Chinese and Cantonese, and discussed work in 

progress for our proposed SoTo method which 

more reasonably treats homophones and better 

models tonal patterns in transliteration.  Future 

work includes testing on larger datasets, more in-

depth error analysis, and developing better meth-

ods to deal with Cantonese transliterations.
