Abstract

In the context of the Document Understand-
ing Conferences, the task of Query-Focused
Multi-Document Summarization is intended to
improve agreement in content among human-
generated model summaries. Query-focus also
aids the automated summarizers in directing
the summary at specific topics, which may re-
sult in better agreement with these model sum-
maries. However, while query focus corre-
lates with performance, we show that high-
performing automatic systems produce sum-
maries with disproportionally higher query
term density than human summarizers do. Ex-
perimental evidence suggests that automatic
systems heavily rely on query term occurrence
and repetition to achieve good performance.

1 Introduction
The problem of automatically summarizing text doc-
uments has received a lot of attention since the early
work by Luhn (Luhn, 1958). Most of the current auto-
matic summarization systems rely on a sentence extrac-
tive paradigm, where key sentences in the original text
are selected to form the summary based on the clues (or
heuristics), or learning based approaches.

Common approaches for identifying key sentences
include: training a binary classifier (Kupiec et al.,
1995), training a Markov model or CRF (Conroy et al.,
2004; Shen et al., 2007) or directly assigning weights
to sentences based on a variety of features and heuris-
tically determined feature weights (Toutanova et al.,
2007). But, the question of which components and fea-
tures of automatic summarizers contribute most to their
performance has largely remained unanswered (Marcu
and Gerber, 2001), until Nenkova et al. (Nenkova et
al., 2006) explored the contribution of frequency based
measures. In this paper, we examine the role a query
plays in automated multi-document summarization of
newswire.

One of the issues studied since the inception of auto-
matic summarization is that of human agreement: dif-
ferent people choose different content for their sum-
maries (Rath et al., 1961; van Halteren and Teufel,
2003; Nenkova et al., 2007). Later, it was as-
sumed (Dang, 2005) that having a question/query to

provide focus would improve agreement between any
two human-generated model summaries, as well as be-
tween a model summary and an automated summary.
Starting in 2005 until 2007, a query-focused multi-
document summarization task was conducted as part of
the annual Document Understanding Conference. This
task models a real-world complex question answering
scenario, where systems need to synthesize from a set
of 25 documents, a brief (250 words), well organized
fluent answer to an information need.

Query-focused summarization is a topic of ongoing
importance within the summarization and question an-
swering communities. Most of the work in this area
has been conducted under the guise of “query-focused
multi-document summarization”, “descriptive question
answering”, or even “complex question answering”.

In this paper, based on structured empirical evalu-
ations, we show that most of the systems participat-
ing in DUC’s Query-Focused Multi-Document Sum-
marization (QF-MDS) task have been query-biased in
building extractive summaries. Throughout our discus-
sion, the term ‘query-bias’, with respect to a sentence,
is precisely defined to mean that the sentence has at
least one query term within it. The term ‘query-focus’
is less precisely defined, but is related to the cognitive
task of focusing a summary on the query, which we as-
sume humans do naturally. In other words, the human
generated model summaries are assumed to be query-
focused.

Here we first discuss query-biased content in Sum-
mary Content Units (SCUs) in Section 2 and then in
Section 3 by building formal models on query-bias we
discuss why/how automated systems are query-biased
rather than being query-focused.

2 Query-biased content in
Summary Content Units (SCUs)

Summary content units, referred as SCUs hereafter, are
semantically motivated subsentential units that are vari-
able in length but not bigger than a sentential clause.
SCUs are constructed from annotation of a collection
of human summaries on a given document collection.
They are identified by noting information that is re-
peated across summaries. The repetition is as small
as a modifier of a noun phrase or as large as a clause.
The evaluation method that is based on overlapping
SCUs in human and automatic summaries is called the

105

pyramid method (Nenkova et al., 2007).
The University of Ottawa has organized the pyramid

annotation data such that for some of the sentences in
the original document collection, a list of correspond-
ing content units is known (Copeck et al., 2006). A
sample of an SCU mapping from topic D0701A of
the DUC 2007 QF-MDS corpus is shown in Figure 1.
Three sentences are seen in the figure among which
two have been annotated with system IDs and SCU
weights wherever applicable. The first sentence has not
been picked by any of the summarizers participating in
Pyramid Evaluations, hence it is unknown if the sen-
tence would have contributed to any SCU. The second
sentence was picked by 8 summarizers and that sen-
tence contributed to an SCU of weight 3. The third
sentence in the example was picked by one summa-
rizer, however, it did not contribute to any SCU. This
example shows all the three types of sentences avail-
able in the corpus: unknown samples, positive samples
and negative samples.

We extracted the positive and negative samples in the
source documents from these annotations; types of sec-
ond and third sentences shown in Figure 1. A total
of 14.8% sentences were annotated to be either posi-
tive or negative. When we analyzed the positive set,
we found that 84.63% sentences in this set were query-
biased. Also, on the negative sample set, we found that
69.12% sentences were query-biased. That is, on an
average, 76.67% of the sentences picked by any au-
tomated summarizer are query-biased. On the other
hand, for human summaries only 58% sentences were
query-biased. All the above numbers are based on the
DUC 2007 dataset shown in boldface in Table 1 1.

There is one caveat: The annotated sentences come
only from the summaries of systems that participated in
the pyramid evaluations. Since only 13 among a total
32 participating systems were evaluated using pyramid
evaluations, the dataset is limited. However, despite
this small issue, it is very clear that at least those sys-
tems that participated in pyramid evaluations have been
biased towards query-terms, or at least, they have been
better at correctly identifying important sentences from
the query-biased sentences than from query-unbiased
sentences.

1We used DUC 2007 dataset for all experiments reported.

3 Formalizing query-bias
Our search for a formal method to capture the relation
between occurrence of query-biased sentences in the
input and in summaries resulted in building binomial
and multinomial model distributions. The distributions
estimated were then used to obtain the likelihood of a
query-biased sentence being emitted into a summary by
each system.

For the DUC 2007 data, there were 45 summaries
for each of the 32 systems (labeled 1-32) among which
2 were baselines (labeled 1 and 2), and 18 summaries
from each of 10 human summarizers (labeled A-J). We
computed the log-likelihood, log(L[summary;p(Ci)]),
of all human and machine summaries from DUC’07
query focused multi-document summarization task,
based on both distributions described below (see Sec-
tions 3.1, 3.2).

3.1 The binomial model

We represent the set of sentences as a binomial distribu-
tion over type of sentences. Let C0 and C1 denote the
sets of sentences without and with query-bias respec-
tively. Let p(Ci) be the probability of emitting a sen-
tence from a specified set. It is also obvious that query-
biased sentences will be assigned lower emission prob-
abilities, because the occurrence of query-biased sen-
tences in the input is less likely. On average each topic
has 549 sentences, among which 196 contain a query
term; which means only 35.6% sentences in the input
were query-biased. Hence, the likelihood function here
denotes the likelihood of a summary to contain non
query-biased sentences. Humans’ and systems’ sum-
maries must now constitute low likelihood to show that
they rely on query-bias.

The likelihood of a summary then is :

L[summary; p(Ci)] =
N !

n0!n1!
p(C0)

n0p(C1)
n1 (1)

Where N is the number of sentences in the sum-
mary, and n0 + n1 = N; n0 and n1 are the cardinali-
ties of C0 and C1 in the summary. Table 2 shows var-
ious systems with their ranks based on ROUGE-2 and
the average log-likelihood scores. The ROUGE (Lin,
2004) suite of metrics are n-gram overlap based met-
rics that have been shown to highly correlate with hu-
man evaluations on content responsiveness. ROUGE-2
and ROUGE-SU4 are the official ROUGE metrics for
evaluating query-focused multi-document summariza-
tion task since DUC 2005.

3.2 The multinomial model

In the previous section (Section 3.1), we described
the binomial model where we classified each sentence
as being query-biased or not. However, if we were
to quantify the amount of query-bias in a sentence,
we associate each sentence to one among k possible
classes leading to a multinomial distribution. Let Ci ∈

Table 3: Rank, Averaged log-likelihood score based on multinomial model, true ROUGE-2 score for the sum-

{C0, C1, C2, . . . , Ck} denote the k levels of query-
bias. Ci is the set of sentences, each having i query
terms.

The number of sentences participating in each class
varies highly, with C0 bagging a high percentage of
sentences (64.4%) and the rest {C1, C2, . . . , Ck} dis-
tributing among themselves the rest 35.6% sentences.
Since the distribution is highly-skewed, distinguish-
ing systems based on log-likelihood scores using this
model is easier and perhaps more accurate. Like be-
fore, Humans’ and systems’ summaries must now con-
stitute low likelihood to show that they rely on query-
bias.

The likelihood of a summary then is :
L[summary; p(Ci)] =

N !

n0!n1! · · · nk!
p(C0)

n0p(C1)
n1 · · · p(Ck)nk

(2)

Where N is the number of sentences in the sum-
mary, and n0 + n1 + · · · + nk = N; n0, n1,· · · ,nk
are respectively the cardinalities of C0, C1, · · · ,Ck,

in the summary. Table 3 shows various systems with
their ranks based on ROUGE-2 and the average log-
likelihood scores.

3.3 Correlation of ROUGE and log-likelihood
scores

Tables 2 and 3 display log-likelihood scores of vari-
ous systems in the descending order of log-likelihood
scores along with their respective ROUGE-2 scores.
We computed the pearson correlation coefficient (ρ) of
‘ROUGE-2 and log-likelihood’ and ‘ROUGE-SU4 and
log-likelihood’. This was computed for systems (ID: 1-
32) (r1) and for humans (ID: A-J) (r2) separately, and
for both distributions.

For the binomial model, r1 = -0.66 and r2 = 0.39 was
obtained. This clearly indicates that there is a strong
negative correlation between likelihood of occurrence
of a non-query-term and ROUGE-2 score. That is, a
strong positive correlation between likelihood of occur-

107



rence of a query-term and ROUGE-2 score. Similarly,
for human summarizers there is a weak negative cor-
relation between likelihood of occurrence of a query-
term and ROUGE-2 score. The same correlation anal-
ysis applies to ROUGE-SU4 scores: r1 = -0.66 and r2
= 0.38.

Similar analysis with the multinomial model have
been reported in Tables 4 and 5. Tables 4 and 5 show
the correlation among ROUGE-2 and log-likelihood
scores for systems2 and humans3.

likelihood scores for humans

4 Conclusions and Discussion

Our results underscore the differences between human
and machine generated summaries. Based on Sum-
mary Content Unit (SCU) level analysis of query-bias
we argue that most systems are better at finding impor-
tant sentences only from query-biased sentences. More
importantly, we show that on an average, 76.67% of
the sentences picked by any automated summarizer are
query-biased. When asked to produce query-focused
summaries, humans do not rely to the same extent on
the repetition of query terms.

We further confirm based on the likelihood of emit-
ting non query-biased sentence, that there is a strong
(negative) correlation among systems’ likelihood score
and ROUGE score, which suggests that systems are
trying to improve performance based on ROUGE met-
rics by being biased towards the query terms. On the
other hand, humans do not rely on query-bias, though
we do not have statistically significant evidence to sug-
gest it. We have also speculated that the multinomial
model helps in better capturing the variance across the
systems since it distinguishes among query-biased sen-
tences by quantifying the amount of query-bias.

From our point of view, most of the extractive sum-
marization algorithms are formalized based on a bag-
of-words query model. The innovation with individ-
ual approaches has been in formulating the actual algo-
rithm on top of the query model. We speculate that

2All the results in Table 4 are statistically significant with
p-value (p < 0.00004, N=32)

3None of the results in Table 5 are statistically significant
with p-value (p > 0.265, N=10)

the real difference in human summarizers and auto-
mated summarizers could be in the way a query (or rel-
evance) is represented. Traditional query models from
IR literature have been used in summarization research
thus far, and though some previous work (Amini and
Usunier, 2007) tries to address this issue using con-
textual query expansion, new models to represent the
query is perhaps one way to induce topic-focus on the
summary. IR-like query models, which are designed
to handle ‘short keyword queries’, are perhaps not ca-
pable of handling ‘an elaborate query’ in case of sum-
marization. Since the notion of query-focus is appar-
ently missing in any or all of the algorithms, the future
summarization algorithms must try to incorporate this
while designing new algorithms.
