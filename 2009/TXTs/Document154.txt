Abstract

This paper presents an effective approach
to discard most entries of the rule table for
statistical machine translation. The rule ta-
ble is filtered by monolingual key phrases,
which are extracted from source text us-
ing a technique based on term extraction.
Experiments show that 78% of the rule ta-
ble is reduced without worsening trans-
lation performance. In most cases, our
approach results in measurable improve-
ments in BLEU score.

1 Introduction

In statistical machine translation (SMT) commu-
nity, the state-of-the-art method is to use rules that
contain hierarchical structures to model transla-
tion, such as the hierarchical phrase-based model
(Chiang, 2005). Rules are more powerful than
conventional phrase pairs because they contain
structural information for capturing long distance
reorderings. However, hierarchical translation
systems often suffer from a large rule table (the
collection of rules), which makes decoding slow
and memory-consuming.

In the training procedure of SMT systems, nu-
merous rules are extracted from the bilingual cor-
pus. During decoding, however, many of them are
rarely used. One of the reasons is that these rules
have low quality. The rule quality are usually eval-
uated by the conditional translation probabilities,
which focus on the correspondence between the
source and target phrases, while ignore the quality
of phrases in a monolingual corpus.

In this paper, we address the problem of reduc-
ing the rule table with the information of mono-
lingual corpus. We use C-value, a measurement
of automatic term recognition, to score source
phrases. A source phrase is regarded as a key
phrase if its score greater than a threshold. Note

that a source phrase is either a flat phrase consists
of words, or a hierarchical phrase consists of both
words and variables. For rule table reduction, the
rule whose source-side is not key phrase is dis-
carded.

Our approach is different from the previous re-
search. Johnson et al. (2007) reduced the phrase
table based on the significance testing of phrase
pair co-occurrence in bilingual corpus. The ba-
sic difference is that they used statistical infor-
mation of bilingual corpus while we use that of
monolingual corpus. Shen et al. (2008) pro-
posed a string-to-dependency model, which re-
stricted the target-side of a rule by dependency
structures. Their approach greatly reduced the rule
table, however, caused a slight decrease of trans-
lation quality. They obtained improvements by
incorporating an additional dependency language
model. Different from their research, we restrict
rules on the source-side. Furthermore, the system
complexity is not increased because no additional
model is introduced.

The hierarchical phrase-based model (Chiang,
2005) is used to build a translation system. Exper-
iments show that our approach discards 78% of the
rule table without worsening the translation qual-
ity.

2 Monolingual Phrase Scoring

2.1 Frequency

The basic metrics for phrase scoring is the fre-
quency that a phrase appears in a monolingual cor-
pus. The more frequent a source phrase appears in
a corpus, the greater possibility the rule that con-
tains the source phrase may be used.

However, one limitation of this metrics is that if
we filter the rule table by the source phrase with
lower frequency, most long phrase pairs will be
discarded. Because the longer the phrase is, the
less possibility it appears. However, long phrases

121



are very helpful for reducing ambiguity since they
contains more information than short phrases.

Another limitation is that the frequency metrics
focuses on a phrase appearing by itself while ig-
nores it appears as a substring of longer phrases.
It is therefore inadequate for hierarchical phrases.

We use an example for illustration. Considering
the following three rules (the subscripts indicate
word alignments):

R1 :
�É1 Ù�2 oÚ3 �4 ��5

accept1 President3 Bush2 ’s4 invitation5

R2 :
�É1 Ù�2 X3 �4 ��5
accept1 X3 Bush2 ’s4 invitation5

R3 :
�É1 X2 �3 ��4
accept1 X2 ’s3 invitation4

We use f1, f2 and f3 to represent their source-
sides, respectively. The hierarchical phrases f2
and f3 are sub-strings of f1. However, R3 is sug-
gested to be more useful than R2. The reason is
that f3 may appears in various phrases, such as
“�É{I���, accept France ’s invitation”.
While f2 almost always appears in f1, indicating
that the variable X may not be replaced with other
words expect “President”. It indicates that R2 is
not likely to be useful, although f2 may appears
frequently in a corpus.

2.2 C-value

C-value, a measurement of automatic term recog-
nition, is proposed by Frantzi and Ananiadou
(1996) to extract nested collocations, collocations
that substrings of other longer ones.

We use C-value for two reasons: on one hand,
it uses rich factors besides phrase frequency, e.g.
the phrase length, the frequency that a sub-phrase
appears in longer phrases. Thus it is appropriate
for extracting hierarchical phrases. On the other
hand, the computation of C-value is efficient.

Analogous to (Frantzi and Ananiadou, 1996),
we use 4 factors (L, F, S, N) to determine if a
phrase p is a key phrase:

1. L(p), the length of p;

2. F (p), the frequency that p appears in a cor-
pus;

Algorithm 1 Key Phrase Extraction
Input: Monolingual Text
Output: Key Phrase Table KP

1: Extract candidate phrases
2: for all phrases p in length descending order

do
3: if N(p) = 0 then
4: C-value = (L(p)− 1)× F (p)
5: else
6: C-value = (L(p)− 1)× (F (p)− S(p)

N(p)
)

7: end if
8: if C-value ≥ ε then
9: add p to KP

10: end if
11: for all sub-strings q of p do
12: S(q) = S(q) + F (p)− S(p)
13: N(q) = N(q) + 1
14: end for
15: end for

3. S(p), the frequency that p appears as a sub-
string in other longer phrases;

4. N(p), the number of phrases that contain p as
a substring.

Given a monolingual corpus, key phrases can be
extracted efficiently according to Algorithm 1.

Firstly (line 1), all possible phrases are ex-
tracted as candidates of key phrases. This step
is analogous to the rule extraction as described in
(Chiang, 2005). The basic difference is that there
are no word alignment constraints for monolingual
phrase extraction, which therefore results in a sub-
stantial number of candidate phrases. We use the
following restrictions to limit the phrase number:

1. The length of a candidate phrase is limited to
pl;

2. The length of the initial phrase used to create
hierarchical phrases is limited to ipl;

3. The number of variables in hierarchical
phrases is limited to nv, and there should be
at least 1 word between variables;

4. The frequency of a candidate phrase appears
in a corpus should be greater than freq.

In our experiments, we set pl = 5, ipl = 10, nv =
2, freq = 3. Note that the first 3 settings are used
in (Chiang, 2005) for rule extraction.

122



Secondly (line 3 to 7), for each candidate
phrase, C-value is computed according to the
phrase appears by itself (line 4) or as a substring
of other long phrases (line 6). The C-value is in
direct proportion to the phrase length (L) and oc-
currences (F, S), while in inverse proportion to the
number of phrases that contain the phrase as a sub-
string (N ). This overcomes the limitations of fre-
quency measurement. A phrase is regarded as a
key phrase if its C-value is greater than a thresh-
old ε.

Finally (line 11 to 14), S(q) and N(q) are up-
dated for each substring q.

We use the example in Section 2.1 for illustra-
tion. The quadruple for f1 is (5, 2, 0, 0), indicating
that the phrase length is 5 and appears 2 times by
itself in the corpus. Therefore C-value(f1) = 8.
The quadruple for f2 is (4, 2, 2, 1), indicating that
the phrase length is 4 and appears 2 times in the
corpus. However, the occurrences are as a sub-
string of the phrase f1. Therefore, C-value(f2) =
0. While the quadruple for f3 is (3, 11, 11, 9),
which indicates that the phrase length is 3 and ap-
pears 11 times as a substring in 9 phrases, thus
C-value(f3) = 19.6. Given the threshold ε = 5,
f1 and f3 are viewed as key phrases. Thus R2 will
be discarded because its source-side is not a key
phrase.

3 Experiments

Our experiments were carried out on two language
pairs:

• Chinese-English: For this task, the corpora
are from the NIST evaluation. The parallel
corpus 1 consists of 1M sentence pairs . We
trained two trigram language models: one on
the Xinhua portion of the Gigaword corpus,
and the other on the target-side of the paral-
lel corpus. The test sets were NIST MT06
GALE set (06G) and NIST set (06N) and
NIST MT08 test set.

• German-English: For this task, the corpora
are from the WMT 2 evaluation. The paral-
lel corpus contains 1.3M sentence pairs. The
target-side was used to train a trigram lan-
guage model. The test sets were WMT06 and
WMT07.

LDC2003E07, LDC2003E14, LDC2004T07, LDC2005T10,
LDC2004T08 HK Hansards (500,000 sentences)

For both the tasks, the word alignment were
trained by GIZA++ in two translation directions
and refined by “grow-diag-final” method (Koehn
et al., 2003). The source-side of the parallel cor-
pus is used to extract key phrases.

3.1 Results

We reimplemented the state-of-the-art hierarchical
MT system, Hiero (Chiang, 2005), as the baseline
system. The results of the experiments are shown
in Table 1 and Table 2.

Table 1 shows the C-value threshold effect
on the size of the rule table, as well as the
BLEU scores. Originally, 103M and 195M rules
are respectively extracted for Chinese-English and
German-English. For both the two tasks, about
78% reduction of the rule table (for Chinese-
English ε = 200 and for German-English ε =
100) does not worsen translation performance. We
achieved improvements in BLEU on most of the
test corpora, except a slight decrease (0.06 point)
on WMT07.

We also compared the effects of frequency and
C-value metrics for the rule table reduction on
Chinese-English test sets. The rule table is re-
duced to the same size (22% of original table)
using the two metrics, separately. However, as
shown in Table 2, the frequency method decreases
the BLEU scores, while the C-value achieves im-
provements. It indicates that C-value is more ap-
propriate than frequency to evaluate the impor-
tance of phrases, because it considers more fac-
tors.

With the rule table filtered by key phrases on
the source side, the number of source phrases re-
duces. Therefore during decoding, a source sen-
tence is suggested to be decomposed into a num-
ber of “key phrases”, which are more reliable than
the discarded phrases. Thus the translation quality
does not become worse.

3.2 Adding C-value as a Feature

Conventional phrase-based approaches performed
phrase segmentation for a source sentence with a
uniform distribution. However, they do not con-
sider the weights of source phrases. Although any
strings can be phrases, it is believed that some
strings are more likely phrases than others. We
use C-value to describe the weight of a phrase in
a monolingual corpus and add it as a feature to the
translation model:

C-value Chinese-English Germany-English
Threshold ε Rule Table (%) 06G 06N 08 Rule Table (%) 06 07

0 100% 12.43 28.58 21.57 100% 27.30 27.95

20 44% 12.24 28.29 21.21 37% 27.47 27.94

300 20% 12.41 27.76 21.52 15% 27.41 27.69
400 18% 11.88 26.98 20.70 13% 27.36 27.76
500 16% 11.65 26.40 20.32 12% 27.25 27.76

The results are shown in the row +CV-Feature
in Table 2. Measurable improvements are ob-
tained on all test corpora of the Chinese-English
task by adding the C-value feature. The improve-
ments over the baseline are statistically significant
at p < 0.01 by using the significant test method
described in (Koehn, 2004).

4 Conclusion

In this paper, we successfully discarded most
entries of the rule table with monolingual key
phrases. Experiments show that about 78% of the
rule table is reduced and the translation quality
does not become worse. We achieve measurable
improvements by incorporating C-value into the
translation model.

The use of key phrases is one of the simplest
method for the rule table reduction. In the future,
we will use sophisticated metrics to score phrases
and reduce the rule table size with the information
of both the source and target sides.
