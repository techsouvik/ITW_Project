Abstract 

In Cross-Language Information Retrieval 
(CLIR), Out-of-Vocabulary (OOV) detection 
and translation pair relevance evaluation still 
remain as key problems. In this paper, an Eng-
lish-Chinese Bi-Directional OOV translation 
model is presented, which utilizes Web mining 
as the corpus source to collect translation pairs 
and combines supervised learning to evaluate 
their association degree. The experimental re-
sults show that the proposed model can suc-
cessfully filter the most possible translation 
candidate with the lower computational cost, 
and improve the OOV translation ranking ef-
fect, especially for popular new words. 

1 Introduction 
In Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR), 
most of queries are generally composed of short 
terms, in which there are many Out-of-
Vocabulary (OOV) terms like named entities, 
new words, terminologies and so on. The transla-
tion quality of OOVs directly influences the pre-
cision of querying relevant multilingual informa-
tion. Therefore, OOV translation has become a 
very important and challenging issue in CLIR. 

The translation of OOVs can either be ac-
quired from parallel or comparable corpus (Lee, 
2006) or mining from Web (Lu, 2004). However, 
how to evaluate the degree of association be-
tween source query term and its target translation 
is quite important. In this paper, an OOV transla-
tion model is established based on the combina-
tion pattern of Web mining and translation rank-
ing. Given an OOV, its related information are 
gotten from search results by search engine, from 
which the possible translation terms in target 
language can be extracted and then ranked 
through supervised learning such as Support 
Vector Machine (SVM) and Ranking-SVM (Cao, 
2006). The basic framework of the translation 
model is shown in Figure 1.

Chinese Bi-Directional OOV translation model. 

2 Related Research Work 
With the rapid growth of Web information, in-
creasing new terms and terminologies cannot be 
found in bilingual dictionaries. The state-of-art 
OOV translation strategies tend to use Web itself 
as a big corpus (Wang, 2004; Zhang, 2004). The 
quick and direct way of getting required informa-
tion from Web pages is to use search engines, 
such as Google, Altavista or Yahoo. Therefore, 
many OOV translation models based on Web 
mining are proposed by researchers (Fang, 2006; 
Wu, 2007). 

By introducing supervised learning mechan-
ism, the relevance between original OOV term 
and extracted candidate translation can be accu-
rately evaluated. Meanwhile, the model proposed 
exhibits better applicability and can also be ap-
plied in processing OOVs with different classes. 

3 Chinese OOV Extraction based on 
PAT-Tree 

For a language that has no words boundary like 
Chinese, PAT-Tree data structure is adopted to 
extract OOV terms (Chien, 1997). The most out-
standing property of this structure is its Semi 
Infinite String, which can store all the semi-
strings of whole corpus in a binary tree. In this 
tree, branch nodes indicate direction of search 

129



and child nodes store information about index 
and frequency of semi infinite strings. With 
common strings being extracted, large amounts 
of noisy terms and fragments are also extracted. 
For example, when searching for the translation 
of English abbreviation term “FDA”, some noisy 
Chinese terms are extracted, such as “国食品” 
(17 times), “美国食品” (16 times), “美国食品
药” (9 times). In order to filter noisy fragments, 
the simplified Local-Maxima algorithm is used 
(Wang, 2004). 

4 Translation Ranking based on Super-
vised Learning 

4.1 Ranking by Classification and Ordinal 
Regression 

Based on the extracted terms, the correct transla-
tion can be chosen further. A direct option is to 
rank them by their frequency or length. It works 
well when the OOV term has a unique meaning 
and all the Web snippets are about the same topic. 
However, in much more cases only the highly 
related fragments of OOV terms can be found, 
rather than their correct translations. To evaluate 
the relevance of translation pair precisely, SVM 
and Ranking-SVM are employed as classifier 
and ordinal regression model respectively. 

4.2 Feature Representation 
The same feature set is utilized by SVM and 
Ranking-SVM. 
(1) Term frequency: fq denotes the frequency of 

OOV to be translated in all the Web snippets 
of search results. tfi indicates the number of 
the translation candidate in all the snippets. 
dfi represents the number of Web snippets 
that contains the candidate. dft means the 
number of snippets that contains both OOV 
to be translated and the candidate. 

(2) Term length: Len( ) is the length of the can-
didate. 

(3) Cooccurrence Distance: C-Dist is the aver-
age distance between the OOV query and the 
translation candidate, computed as follows. 

( )
-

t

Sum Dist
C Dist

df
=            (1) 

where Sum(Dist) is the sum of distance in 
each translation pair of every snippet. 

(4) Length Ratio: This is the ratio of OOV query 
length and translation candidate length. 

(5) Rank Value: 
i. Top Rank (T-Rank): The rank of snippet 

that first contains the candidate. This 

value indicates the rank given by search 
engine. 

ii. Average_Rank (A-Rank): It is the aver-
age position of candidate in snippets of 
search results, shown as follows.

RankA =−                  (2) 

where Sum(Rank) denotes the sum of 
every single rank value of snippets that 
contains the candidate. 

iii. Simple_Rank (S-Rank): It is computed 
based on Rank(i)=tfi*Len(i), which aims 
at investigating the impact of these two 
features on ranking translation. 

iv. R-Rank: This rank method is utilized as a 
comparison basis, computed as follows. 

( )
OOV

nn

f

L
S

RankR ×−+×=− αα 1            (3) 

where α is set as 0.25 empirically, |Sn| 
represents the length of candidate term, 
L is the largest length of candidate terms, 
fn is tfi, and foov is fq in Feature (1). 

v. Df_Rank (D-Rank): It is similar to S-
Rank and computed based on Rank(i)= 
dfi *Len(i). 

(6) Mark feature: Within a certain distance 
(usually less than 10 characters) between the 
original OOV and candidate, if there is such 
a term like “全称”, “中文叫”, “中文译为”, 
“中文名称”, “中文称为”, “或称为”, “又称
为”, “英文叫”, “英文名为”, this feature will 
be labeled as “+1”, else “-1” instead. 

Among these features above, some features 
come from search engine like (1) and (5) and 
some ones from heuristic rules like (3) and (6).  
Through the establishment of feature set, the 
translation candidate can be optimized efficiently 
and the noisy information can also be filtered. 

5 Experiment and Analysis 

5.1 Data Set 
For the performance evaluation of Chinese-
English OOV translation, the corpus of NER task 
in SIGHAN 2008 provided by Peking University 
is used. The whole corpus contains 19,866 per-
son names, 22,212 location names and 7,837 or-
ganization names, from which 100 person names, 
100 location names and 100 organization names 
are selected for testing. Meanwhile, 300 English 
named entities are chosen randomly from the 
terms of 9 categories, which include movie name, 
book title, organization name, brand name, ter-
minology, idiom, rare animal name, person name 

130



and so on. These new terms are used as the test-
ing data for English-Chinese OOV translation. 

5.2 Evaluation Metrics 
Three parameters are used for the evaluation of 
translation and ranking candidates.

where T denotes the number of testing entities. 
The first one is a measurement for translation 
and the others are used for ranking measurement. 

5.3 Experiment on Parameter Setting 
Frequency and length are two crucial features for 
translation candidates. To get the most related 
terms into top 10 before the final ranking, a pre-
rank testing is performed based on S-Rank, R-
Rank and D-Rank. It can be seen from Figure 2 
that the pre-rank by D-Rank exhibits better per-
formance in translation experiment. 

 
Figure 2. The impact of different Pre-Rank man-

ners on English-Chinese OOV translation. 
In search results, for some English OOV terms 

such as “BYOB(自带酒水)”, there are few candi-
dates with better quality in top 20 snippets. 
Therefore, in order to find how many snippets 
are suitable in translation, the experiment on 
snippet number is performed. It can be observed 
from Figure 3 that the best performance can be 
obtained by utilizing 200 snippets.

5.4 Experiment On English-Chinese Bi-
Directional OOV Translation 

The experimental results on 300 English new 
terms are shown in Table 1.

The experimental results on 300 Chinese 
named entities are shown in Table 2.

Top-9 0.540 0.930 0.630 

Table 2. The experimental results on Chinese-
English OOV translation. 

It can be observed from Table 2 that the per-
formance of Chinese location name translation is 
much higher than the other two categories. This 
is because most of the location names are famous 
cities or countries. The experimental results 
above demonstrate that the proposed model can 
be applicable in all kinds of OOV terms. 

5.5 Experiment on Ranking 
In SVM-based and Ranking-SVM-based ranking 
experiment, the statistics on training data are 
shown in Table 3. For SVM training data, the 
“Related” candidates are neglected. The experi-
mental results on ranking in English-Chinese and 
Chinese-English OOV translation are shown in 
Table 4 and 5 respectively.

From the experiments above, it can be con-
cluded that the supervised learning significantly 
outperform the conventional ranking strategies. 

5.6 Analysis and Discussion 
Through analysis about the experimental results 
in extraction and ranking, it can be observed that 
the OOV translation quality is highly related to 
the following aspects. 
(1) The translation results are related to the 

search engine used, especially for some spe-
cific OOV terms. For example, given a query 
OOV term “两岸三通”, the mining result 
based on Google in China is “three direct 
links”, while some meaningless information 
is mined by the other engines like Live Trans. 

(2) Some terms are conventional terminologies 
and cannot be translated literally. For exam-
ple, “woman pace-setter”, a proper name with 
the particular Chinese characteristic, should 
be translated into “三八红旗手”, rather than 
“女子的步伐” or “制定”. 

(3) The proposed model is sensitive to the nota-
bility degree of OOV term. For famous per-
son name and book title, the translation per-
formance is very promising. However, for 
other OOV terms with lower notability, such 
as “贝尔曼来” and “兰红光”, the correct 
translation cannot even be retrieved by 
search engine. 

(4) Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) should 
be added to improve the whole translation 
performance. Although most of OOVs have 
unique semantic definition, there are still a 
few OOVs with ambiguity. For example, 
“Rice” can either be a person name or a kind 
of food. Another example is “AARP”, which 
also has two kinds of meaning, that is, “美国
退休者协会” and “地址解析协议”. 

6 Conclusions and Future Work 
In this paper, the proposed model improves the 
acquirement ability for OOV translation through 
Web mining and solves the translation pair eval-
uation problem in a novel way by introducing 

supervised learning in translation ranking. In ad-
dition, it is very significant to apply the key 
techniques in traditional machine translation into 
OOV translation, such as OOV recognition, sta-
tistical machine learning, alignment of sentence 
and phoneme, and WSD. The merits of these 
techniques should be integrated. All these as-
pects above will become the research focus in 
our future work.
