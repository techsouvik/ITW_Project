Abstract 

 

In this paper, emotion analysis on blog texts 

has been carried out for a less privileged lan-

guage like Bengali. Ekman’s six basic emotion 

types have been selected for reliable and semi 

automatic word level annotation. An automatic 

classifier has been applied for recognizing six 

basic emotion types for different words in a 

sentence. Application of different scoring 

strategies to identify sentence level emotion 

tag based on the acquired word level emotion 

constituents have produced satisfactory per-

formance.  

1 Introduction 

Emotion is a private state that is not open to ob-

jective observation or verification. So, the identi-

fication of the emotional state of natural lan-

guage texts is really a challenging issue. Most of 

the related work has been conducted for English.   

    The approach in this paper is to assign emo-

tion tags on the Bengali blog sentences with one 

of the Ekman’s (1993) six basic emotion types 

such as happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise 

and disgust. The system consists of two phases, 

machine learning based word level emotion clas-

sification followed by assignment of sentence 

level emotion tags based on the word level con-

stituents using sense based scoring mechanism. 

The classifier accuracy has been measured 

through confusion matrix. Corpus based and 

sense based tag weights have been calculated for 

each of the six emotion tags and then these emo-

tion tag weights have been used to identify sen-

tence level emotion tag. The tuned reference 

ranges selected from the development set have 

proved effective on the test set.  

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. 

Section 2 describes the related work. Section 3 

briefly describes the resource preparation.  Ma-

chine learning based word level emotion tagging 

system framework and its evaluation results have 

been discussed in section 4. Section 5 describes 

the calculation of tag weights, sentence level 

emotion detection process based on the tag 

weights, evaluation strategies and results. Finally 

section 6 concludes the paper.  

2 Related Work 

(Mishne et al., 2006) used several supervised and 

unsupervised machine learning techniques on 

blog data for comparative evaluation. Importance 

of verbs and adjectives in identifying emotion 

has been explained in (Chesley et al., 2006). 

(Yang et al., 2007) has used Yahoo! Kimo Blog 

corpora containing emoticons associated with 

textual keywords to build emotion lexicons. 

(Chen et al., 2007) has experimented the emotion 

classification task on web blog corpora using 

Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Conditional 

Random Field (CRF) and the observed results 

have shown that the CRF classifiers outperform 

SVM classifiers in case of document level emo-

tion detection. 

3 Resource Preparation  

Bengali is a less computerized language and 

there is no existing emotion word list or Senti-

WordNet in Bengali. The English WordNet Af-

fect lists, (Strapparava et al., 2004) based on Ek-

man’s six basic emotion types have been updated 

with the synsets retrieved from the English Sen-

tiWordNet to have adequate number of emotion 

word entries.  

These lists have been converted to Bengali us-

ing English to Bengali bilingual dictionary
1

. 

These six lists have been termed as Emotion lists. 

A Bengali SentiWordNet is being developed by 

replacing each word entry in the synonymous set 

of the English SentiWordNet (Esuli et al., 2006)

by its equivalent Bengali meaning using the same 

English to Bengali bilingual dictionary.  

A knowledge base for the emoticons has been 

prepared by experts after minutely analyzing the 

Bengali blog data. Each image link of the emoti-

con in the raw corpus has been mapped into its 

corresponding textual entity in the tagged corpus 

with the proper emotion tags using the knowl-

edge base. The Bengali blog data have been col-

lected from the web blog archive 

(www.amarblog.com) containing 1300 sentences 

on 14 different topics and their corresponding 

user comments have been retrieved.   

4 Word Level Emotion Classification 

Primarily, the word level annotation has been 

semi-automatically carried out using Ekman’s six 

basic emotion tags. The assignment of emotion 

tag to a word has been done based on the type of 

the Emotion Word lists in which that word is pre-

sent. Other non-emotional words have been 

tagged with neutral type. 1000 sentences have 

been considered for training of the CRF based 

word level emotion classification module. Rest 

200 and 100 sentences, verified by language ex-

perts to perform evaluation have been considered 

as development and test data respectively.  

4.1 Feature Selection and Training  

The Conditional Random Field (CRF) 

(McCallum, 2001) framework has been used for 

training as well as for the classification of each 

word of a sentence into the above-mentioned six 

emotion tags and one neutral tag. By manually 

reviewing the Bengali blog data and different 

language specific characteristics, 10 active fea-

tures have been selected heuristically for our 

classification task. Each feature value is boolean 

in nature, with discrete value for intensity feature 

at the word level. 

 POS information: We are interested with 
the verb, noun, adjective and adverb words 

as these are emotion informative constitu-

ents. For this feature, total 1300 sentences 

has been passed through a Bengali part of 

speech tagger (Ekbal et al. 2008) based on 

Support Vector Machine (SVM) tech-

nique. The POS tagger was developed 

with a tagset of 26 POS tags
2
, defined for 

the Indian languages. The POS tagger has 

demonstrated an overall accuracy of ap-

proximately 90%.

 First sentence in a topic: It has been ob-
served that first sentence of the topic gen-

erally contains emotion (Roth et.al., 2005). 

 SentiWordNet emotion word: A word 
appearing in the SentiWordNet (Bengali) 

contains an emotion. 

 Reduplication: The reduplicated words 
(e.g., bhallo bhallo [good good], khokhono 

khokhono [when when] etc.) in Bengali are 

most likely emotion words. 

 Question words: It has been observed 
that the question words generally contrib-

ute to the emotion in a sentence. 

 Colloquial / Foreign words: The collo-
quial words (e.g., kshyama [pardon] etc.) 

and foreign words (e.g. Thanks, gossya 

[anger] etc.) are highly rich with their 

emotional contents. 

 Special punctuation symbols: The sym-
bols (e.g. !, ?, @ etc ) appearing at the 

word / sentence level convey emotions.  

 Quoted sentence: The sentences espe-
cially remarks or direct speech always 

contain emotion. 

 Negative word: Negative words such as 
na (no), noy (not) etc. reverse the meaning 

of the emotion in a sentence. Such words 

are appropriately tagged. 

 Emoticons: The emoticons and their con-
secutive occurrences generally contribute 

as much as real sentiment to the words or 

sentences that precede or follow it.

Different unigram and bi-gram context fea-

tures (word level as well as POS tag level) and 

their combination has been generated from the 

training corpus. The following sentence contains 

four features (Colloquial word (khyama), special 

150



symbol (!), quoted sentence and emotion word 

(?JQCJ [happy])) together and all these four fea-
tures are important to identify the emotion of this 

sentence. 

      kピJ@J   9Jo!    “তM K@    ?JQCJ     sCJক”  
    (khyama) (dao)!   “(tumi)  (bhalo)  (lok)”      

    (Forgive)!            “(you)   (good)   (person)” 

4.2 Evaluation Results of the Word-level 

Emotion Classification   

Evaluation results of the development set have 

demonstrated an accuracy of 56.45%. Error 

analysis has been conducted with the help of 

confusion matrix as shown in Table 2. A close 

investigation of the evaluation results suggests 

that the errors are mostly due to the uneven dis-

tribution between emotion and non-emotion tags.   

 

Tags happy   sad   ang     dis    fear  sur    ntrl 

happy   

sad    

ang      

dis     

fear    

sur

            0.01   0.05   0.0    0.0    0.0   0.03

0.0       0.0     0.0     0.0             0.0   0.01 

0.02     0.007 0.0     0.0    0.0            0.01 

0.0       0.0     0.0     0.0    0.0    0.0  

Table 2: Confusion matrix for development set  

 

The number of non-emotional or neutral type 

tags is comparatively higher than other emotional 

tags in a sentence. So, one solution to this unbal-

anced class distribution is to split the ‘non-

emotion’ (emo_ntrl) class into several subclasses. 

That is, given a POS tagset POS, we generate 

new emotion classes, ‘emo_ntrl-C’|CPOS. We 
have 26 sub-classes, which correspond, to non-

emotion tags such as ‘emo_ntrl-NN’ (common 

noun), ‘emo_ntrl-VFM’ (verb finite main) etc. 

Evaluation results of the system with the inclu-

sion of this class splitting technique have shown 

the accuracies of 64.65% and 66.74% on the de-

velopment and test data respectively.   

5 Sentence Level Emotion Tagging 

This module has been developed to identify sen-

tence level emotion tags based on the word level 

emotion tags. 

5.1 Calculation of Emotion Tag weights 

Sense_Tag_Weight (STW): The tag weight has 

been calculated using SentiWordNet. We have 

selected the basic six words “happy”, “sad”, 

“anger”, “disgust”, “fear” “surprise” as the seed 

words corresponding to each emotion type. The 

positive and negative scores in the English Sen-

tiWordNet for each synset in which each of these 

seed words appear have been retrieved and the 

average of the scores has been fixed as the 

Sense_Tag_Weight of that particular emotion tag.   

Corpus_Tag_Weight (CTW): This tag weight 

for each emotion tag has been calculated based 

on the frequency of occurrence of an emotion tag 

with respect to the total number of occurrences 

of all six types of emotion tags in the annotated 

corpus. 

 

Tag Types        CTW                     STW

      0.0959              ( - ) 0.5 

      0.1032              ( - ) 0.075 

      0.0465                     0.0131 

      0.0371                     0.0625 

      0.0                           0.0 

Table 3: CTW and STW for each of six emotion 

tags with neutral tag 

5.2 Scoring Techniques 

The following two scoring techniques depending 

on two calculated tag weights (in section 5.1) 

have been adopted for selecting the best possible 

sentence level emotion tags.  

(1) Sense_Weight_Score (SWS): Each sen-

tence is assigned a Sense_Weight_Score (SWS) 

for each emotion tag which is calculated by di-

viding the total Sense_Tag_Weight (STW)of all 

occurrences of an emotion tag in the sentence by 

the total Sense_Tag_Weight (STW) of all types 

of emotion tags present in that sentence. The 

Sense_Weight_Score is calculated as  

SWSi = (STWi * Ni) / (∑ j=1 to 7 STWj * Nj) | i め j 
where SWSi is the Sentence level 

Sense_Weight_Score for the emotion tag i in the 

sentence and Ni is the number of occurrences of 

that emotion tag in the sentence. STWi and STWj 

are the Sense_Tag_Weights for the emotion tags i 

and j respectively. Each sentence has been as-

signed with the sentence level emotion tag SETi 

for which SWSi is highest, i.e., 

SETi = [max i=1 to 6(SWSi)].  
(2) Corpus_Weight_Score (CWS): This meas-

ure is calculated in a similar manner by using the 

CTW of each emotion tag. The corresponding 

Bengali sentence is assigned with the emotion 

tag for which the sentence level CWS is highest. 

The scoring mechanism has been considered for 

verifying any domain related biasness of emotion 

and their influence in emotion detection process.

5.3 Evaluation Results of Sentence Level 

Emotion Tagging 

Each sentence in the development and test sets 

have been annotated with positive or negative or 

neutral valence and with any of the six emotion 

tags. The SWS has been used in identifying va-

lence scores as there is no valence information 

carried by CWS. The sentences for which the 

total SWS produced positive, negative and zero 

(0) values have been tagged as positive, negative 

and neutral type. Any domain biasness through 

CWS has been re-evaluated through SWS also. 

We have taken the Bengali corpus from comic 

related background. So, during analysis on the 

development set, the CWS outperforms the SWS 

significantly in identifying happy, disgust, fear 

and surprise sentence level emotion tags. The 

other SETs have been identified through SWS as 

the CWS for these SETs are significantly less 

than their corresponding SWS as shown in Table 

5. The knowledge and information of the refer-

ence ranges (shown in Table 4) of SWS and 

CWS for assigning valence and six other emotion 

tags, acquired after tuning of development set, 

have been applied on the test set. The valence 

and emotion tag assignment process has been 

evaluated using accuracy measure on test data. 

The difference in the accuracies for the develop-

ment and test sets is negligible. It signifies that 

the best possible reference range for valence and 

other emotion tags have been selected. Results in 

Table 5 show that the system has performed sat-

isfactorily for valence identification as well as 

for sentence level emotion tagging.   

Table 4: Reference ranges 

6 Conclusion  

The hierarchical ordering of the word level to 

sentence level and from sentence level to docu-

ment level can be considered as the well favored 

route to track the document level emotional ori-

entation. The handling of negative words and 

metaphors and their impact in detecting sentence 

level emotion along with document level analysis 

are the future areas to be explored.
