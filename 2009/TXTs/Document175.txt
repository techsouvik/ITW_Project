Abstract 

In this paper, we propose a method for compiling 

travel information automatically. For the compi-

lation, we focus on travel blogs, which are de-

fined as travel journals written by bloggers in 

diary form. We consider that travel blogs are a 

useful information source for obtaining travel 

information, because many bloggers' travel expe-

riences are written in this form. Therefore, we 

identified travel blogs in a blog database and ex-

tracted travel information from them. We have 

confirmed the effectiveness of our method by 

experiment. For the identification of travel blogs, 

we obtained scores of 38.1% for Recall and 

86.7% for Precision. In the extraction of travel 

information from travel blogs, we obtained 

74.0% for Precision at the top 100 extracted local 

products, thereby confirming that travel blogs are 

a useful source of travel information. 

1 Introduction 

Travel guidebooks and portal sites provided by 

tour companies and governmental tourist boards 

are useful sources of information about travel. 

However, it is costly and time consuming to 

compile travel information for all tourist spots 

and to keep them up to date manually. Therefore 

we have studied the automatic compilation of 

travel information. 

For the compilation, we focused on travel 

blogs, which are defined as travel journals writ-

ten by bloggers in diary form. Travel blogs are 

considered a useful information source for ob-

taining travel information, because many blog-

gers' travel experiences are written in this form. 

Therefore, we identified travel blogs in a blog 

database, and extracted travel information from 

them. 

Travel information in travel blogs is also use-

ful for recommending information that is 

matched to the each traveler. Recently, several 

methods that identify bloggers' attributes such as 

residential area (Yasuda et al., 2006), gender, 

and age (Ikeda et al., 2008, Schler et al., 2006), 

have been proposed. By combining this research 

with travel information extracted from travel 

blogs, it is possible to recommend a local prod-

uct that is popular among females, for example, 

or a travel spot, where young people often visit. 

The remainder of this paper is organized as 

follows. Section 2 describes related work. Sec-

tion 3 describes our method. To investigate the 

effectiveness of our method, we conducted some 

experiments, and Section 4 reports the experi-

mental results. We present some conclusions in 

Section 5. 

2 Related Work 

Both 'www.travelblog.org' and 

'travel.blogmura.com' are portal sites for travel 

blogs. At these sites, travel blogs are manually 

registered by bloggers themselves, and the blogs 

are classified by their destinations. However, 

there are many more travel blogs in the blogos-

205



phere. Aiming to construct an exhaustive data-

base of travel blogs, we have studied the auto-

matic identification of travel blogs.  

GeoCLEF
1
 is the cross-language geographic 

retrieval track run as part of the Cross Language 

Evaluation Forum (CLEF), and has been operat-

ing since 2005 (Gey et al., 2005). The goal of 

this task was to retrieve news articles relevant to 

particular aspects of geographic information, 

such as 'wine regions around the rivers in Eu-

rope'. In our work, we focused on travel blogs 

instead of news articles, because bloggers' travel 

experiences tend to be written in travel blogs. 

3 Automatic Compilation of Travel In-

formation 

The task of compiling travel information is di-

vided into two steps: (1) identification of travel 

blogs and (2) extraction of travel information 

from them. We explain these steps in Sections 

3.1 and 3.2. 

3.1 Identification of Travel Blogs 

Blog entries that contain cue phrases, such as 

'travel', 'sightseeing', or 'tour', have a high degree 

of probability of being travel blogs. However, 

not every travel blog contains such cue phrases. 

For example, if a blogger writes his/her journey 

to Norway in multiple blog entries, it might state 

'We traveled to Norway' in the first entry, while 

only writing 'We ate wild sheep!' in the second 

entry. In this case, because the second entry does 

not contain any expressions related to travel, it is 

difficult to identify that the second entry is a tra-

vel blog. Therefore, we focus not only on each 

entry but also on its surrounding entries for the 

identification of travel blogs.  

We formulated the identification of travel 

blogs as a sequence-labeling problem, and solved 

it using machine learning. For the machine learn-

ing method, we examined the Conditional Ran-

dom Fields (CRF) method, whose empirical suc-

cess has been reported recently in the field of 

natural language processing. The CRF-based me-

thod identifies the class of each entry. Features 

and tags are given in the CRF method as follows: 

(1) the k tags occur before a target entry, (2) k 

features occur before a target entry, and (3) k 

features follow a target entry (see Figure 1). We 

used the value of k=4, which was determined in a 

pilot study. Here, we used the following features 

for machine learning: whether an entry contains

each 416 cue phrase, such as '旅行 (travel)', 'ツ

アー  (tour)', and '出発  (departure)', and the 
number of location names in each entry

3.2 Extraction of Travel Information from 

Blogs 

We extracted pairs comprising a location name 

and a local product from travel blogs, which 

were identified in the previous step. For the effi-

cient extraction of travel information, we em-

ployed a bootstrapping method. Firstly, we pre-

pared 482 location-name/and local-product pairs 

as seeds for the bootstrapping. These pairs were 

obtained automatically from a 'Web Japanese N-

gram' database
3
 provided by Google, Inc. The 

database comprises N-grams (N=1–7) extracted 

from 20 billion of Japanese sentences on the web. 

We applied a pattern '[地名]名物「[名物]」 ' 

([slot of 'location name'] local product 「[slot of 

'local product name']」) to the database, and ex-
tracted location names and local products from 

each corresponding slot, thereby obtaining the 

482 pairs. 

Secondly, we applied a machine learning-

based information extraction technique to the 

travel blogs identified in the previous step, and 

obtained new pairs. In this step, we prepared

 We used CaboCha software for the identification of 

locations.

training data for the machine learning in the fol-

lowing three steps. 

1. Select 200 sentences that contain both a lo-

cation name and a local product from the 

482 pairs. Then automatically create 200 

tagged sentences, to which 'location' and 

'product' tags are assigned. 

2. Prepare another 200 sentences that contain 

only a location name.
4
 Then create 200 

tagged sentences, to which the 'location' tag 

is assigned. 

3. Apply machine learning to the 400 tagged 

sentences, and obtain a system that automat-

ically annotates 'location' and 'product' tags 

to given sentences. 

As a machine learning method, we used the CRF. 

In the same way as in the previous step, the 

CRF-based method identifies the class of each 

word in a given sentence. Features and tags are 

given in the CRF method as follows: (1) the k 

tags occur before a target word, (2) k features 

occur before a target word, and (3) k features 

follow a target word. We used the value of k=2, 

which was determined in a pilot study. We use 

the following six features for machine learning. 

� A word. 

� Its part of speech
5
. 

� Whether the word is a quotation mark. 

� Whether the word is a cue word, such as '名

物 ', '名産 ', '特産 ' (local product), '銘菓 ' 

(famous confection), or '土産' (souvenir). 
� Whether the word is a surface case. 

� Whether the word is frequently used in the 

names of local products or souvenirs, such 

as 'cake' or 'noodle'. 

4 Experiments 

We conducted two experiments: (1) identifica-

tion of travel blogs, and (2) extraction of travel 

information from blogs. We reported on them in 

Sections 4.1 and 4.2.

Data sets and experimental settings

 In our pilot study, we did not use these negative cas-

es in machine learning at first, and obtained low pre-

cision values, because our system attempted to extract 

local products from all sentences containing location 

names in travel blogs. 
5
 In this step, we also identified location names auto-

matically using the CaboCha software. 

We randomly selected 4,914 blog entries written 

by 317 authors from about 1,100,000 entries 

written in Japanese. Then we manually identified 

travel blogs in 4,914 entries. As a result, 420 en-

tries were identified as travel blogs. Then we 

performed a four-fold cross-validation test. For 

the machine-learning package, we used CRF++
6
 

software. For evaluation measures, we used Re-

call and Precision scores. 

Alternatives 

In order to confirm the validity of our sequence 

labeling-based approach, we also examined 

another method, which identifies travel blogs 

using features in each blog entry only (without 

using features in its surrounding entries). 

Results and discussions 

Table 1 shows the experimental results. As 

shown in the table, our method improved the 

Precision value by 26.2%, while decreasing the 

Recall value by 13.0%. In our research, Precision 

is more important than Recall, because low Pre-

cision in this step causes low Precision in the 

next step. 

 Recall Precision 

our method 38.1 86.7 

baseline method 51.1 60.5 
Table 1: Identification of travel blogs 

Our method could not identify 266 of the tra-

vel blogs. We randomly selected 50 entries from 

these 266, and analysed the errors. Among the 50 

errors, 25 cases (50%) were caused by the lack of 

cue phrases. For the machine learning, we used 

manually selected cue phrases. To increase the 

number of cue phrases, a statistical approach will 

be required. For example, applying n-grams to 

automatically identified travel blogs is one such 

approach. Among the 50 errors, 5 entries (10%) 

were too short (fewer than four sentences) to be 

identified by our method. 

Our method mistakenly identified 26 entries as 

travel blogs. A typical error is that bloggers 

wrote non-travel entries among a series of travel 

blogs. In this case, the non-travel entries were 

identified as travel blogs. 

4.2 Extraction of Travel Information from 

Blogs 

Data sets and experimental settings 

To confirm that travel blogs are a useful informa-

tion source for the extraction of travel informa-

tion, we extracted travel information using the 

following three information sources.

� Travel blogs (our method): 80,000 sen-

tences in 17,268 travel blogs, which were 

automatically identified from 1,100,000 en-

tries using the method described in Section 

3.1. 

� Generic blogs: 80,000 sentences from 

1,100,000 blog entries. 

� Generic webs: 80,000 sentences from 

470M web sentences (Kawahara and Kuro-

hashi, 2006). 

We extracted travel information (location-

name/local-product pairs) from each information 

source, and ranked them by their frequencies. 

Evaluation 

We used the Precision value for the top-ranked 

travel information defined by the following equa-

tion as the evaluation measure. We calculated 

Precision values from the top 5 to the top 100 at 

intervals of 5. 

Precision=

The number of correctly extracted 

location-name / local-product

pairs

 
The number of extracted

location-name / local-product

pairs

 

Results and discussions 

Figure 2 shows the experimental results. As 

shown in the figure, the generic blog method ob-

tained higher Precision values than the generic 

web method, especially at higher ranks. Our me-

thod (travel blog) was much better than the ge-

neric blog method, which indicates that travel 

blogs are a useful information source for the ex-

traction of travel information.  

 
Figure 2: Precision values at top n for the extraction 

of travel information 

Table 2 shows the number of local products, 

which were not contained in a list of products 

from the Google N-gram database. As shown in 

the table, 41 local products were newly extracted 

from travel blogs, while 15 and 7 were extracted 

from generic blogs and generic webs, respective-

ly. These results also indicate the effectiveness of 

travel blogs as a source for travel information. 

A typical error among the top 100 results for 

our method was that store names were mistaken-

ly extracted. Here, most of these stores sell local 

products. To ameliorate this problem, extraction 

of pairs of local products and the stores that sell 

them is also required.

5 Conclusion 

In this paper, we proposed a method for identify-

ing travel blogs from a blog database, and ex-

tracting travel information from them. In the 

identification of travel blogs, we obtained of 

38.1% for Recall and 86.7% for Precision. In the 

extraction of travel information from travel blogs, 

we obtained 74.0% for Precision with the top 

100 extracted local products.
