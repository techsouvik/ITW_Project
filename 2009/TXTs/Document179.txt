Abstract

The Columbia Arabic Treebank (CATiB)
is a database of syntactic analyses of Ara-
bic sentences. CATiB contrasts with pre-
vious approaches to Arabic treebanking
in its emphasis on speed with some con-
straints on linguistic richness. Two ba-
sic ideas inspire the CATiB approach: no
annotation of redundant information and
using representations and terminology in-
spired by traditional Arabic syntax. We
describe CATiB’s representation and an-
notation procedure, and report on inter-
annotator agreement and speed.

1 Introduction and Motivation

Treebanks are collections of manually-annotated
syntactic analyses of sentences. They are pri-
marily intended for building models for statis-
tical parsing; however, they are often enriched
for general natural language processing purposes.
For Arabic, two important treebanking efforts ex-
ist: the Penn Arabic Treebank (PATB) (Maamouri
et al., 2004) and the Prague Arabic Dependency
Treebank (PADT) (Smrž and Hajič, 2006). In
addition to syntactic annotations, both resources
are annotated with rich morphological and seman-
tic information such as full part-of-speech (POS)
tags, lemmas, semantic roles, and diacritizations.
This allows these treebanks to be used for training
a variety of applications other than parsing, such
as tokenization, diacritization, POS tagging, mor-
phological disambiguation, base phrase chunking,
and semantic role labeling.

In this paper, we describe a new Arabic tree-
banking effort: the Columbia Arabic Treebank
(CATiB).1 CATiB is motivated by the following
three observations. First, as far as parsing Arabic
research, much of the non-syntactic rich annota-
tions are not used. For example, PATB has over
400 tags, but they are typically reduced to around
36 tags in training and testing parsers (Kulick et

1This work was supported by Defense Advanced Re-
search Projects Agency Contract No. HR0011-08-C-0110.

al., 2006). The reduction addresses the fact that
sub-tags indicating case and other similar features
are essentially determined syntactically and are
hard to automatically tag accurately. Second, un-
der time restrictions, the creation of a treebank
faces a tradeoff between linguistic richness and
treebank size. The richer the annotations, the
slower the annotation process, the smaller the re-
sulting treebank. Obviously, bigger treebanks are
desirable for building better parsers. Third, both
PATB and PADT use complex syntactic represen-
tations that come from modern linguistic traditions
that differ from Arabic’s long history of syntac-
tic studies. The use of these representations puts
higher requirements on the kind of annotators to
hire and the length of their initial training.

CATiB contrasts with PATB and PADT in
putting an emphasis on annotation speed for the
specific task of parser training. Two basic ideas
inspire the CATiB approach. First, CATiB avoids
annotation of redundant linguistic information or
information not targeted in current parsing re-
search. For example, nominal case markers in
Arabic have been shown to be automatically de-
terminable from syntax and word morphology and
needn’t be manually annotated (Habash et al.,
2007a). Also, phrasal co-indexation, empty pro-
nouns, and full lemma disambiguation are not
currently used in parsing research so we do not
include them in CATiB. Second, CATiB uses a
simple intuitive dependency representation and
terminology inspired by Arabic’s long tradition
of syntactic studies. For example, CATiB rela-
tion labels include tamyiz (specification) and idafa
(possessive construction) in addition to universal
predicate-argument structure labels such as sub-
ject, object and modifier. These representation
choices make it easier to train annotators without
being restricted to hire people who have degrees
in linguistics.

This paper briefly describes CATiB’s repre-
sentation and annotation procedure, and reports
on produced data, achieved inter-annotator agree-
ment and annotation speeds.

2 CATiB: Columbia Arabic Treebank

CATiB uses the same basic tokenization scheme
used by PATB and PADT. However, the CATiB
POS tag set is much smaller than the PATB’s.
Whereas PATB uses over 400 tags specifying
every aspect of Arabic word morphology such
as definiteness, gender, number, person, mood,
voice and case, CATiB uses 6 POS tags: NOM
(non-proper nominals including nouns, pronouns,
adjectives and adverbs), PROP (proper nouns),
VRB (active-voice verbs), VRB-PASS (passive-
voice verbs), PRT (particles such as prepositions
or conjunctions) and PNX (punctuation).2

CATiB’s dependency links are labeled with one
of eight relation labels: SBJ (subject of verb
or topic of simple nominal sentence), OBJ (ob-
ject of verb, preposition, or deverbal noun), TPC
(topic in complex nominal sentences containing
an explicit pronominal referent), PRD (predicate
marking the complement of the extended cop-
ular constructions for kAn3 Aî�E@ñ 	k@ð 	àA¿ and An
Aî

�
E@ñ

	
k@ð

	
à@), IDF (relation between the posses-

sor [dependent] to the possessed [head] in the
idafa/possesive nominal construction), TMZ (re-
lation of the specifier [dependent] to the specified
[head] in the tamyiz/specification nominal con-
structions), MOD (general modifier of verbs or
nouns), and — (marking flatness inside construc-
tions such as first-last proper name sequences).
This relation label set is much smaller than the
twenty or so dashtags used in PATB to mark syn-
tactic and semantic functions. No empty cate-
gories and no phrase co-indexation are made ex-
plicit. No semantic relations (such as time and
place) are annotated.

Figure 1 presents an example of a tree in CATiB
annotation. In this example, the verb @ðP@ 	P zArwA
‘visited’ heads a subject, an object and a prepo-
sitional phrase. The subject includes a com-
plex number construction formed using idafa and
tamyiz and headed by the number 	àñ�Ô

‘fifty’, which is the only carrier of the subject’s
syntactic nominative case here. The preposition ú

ing features from the annotated trees. Details of this result
will be presented in a future publication.

3 Annotation Procedure

Although CATiB is independent of previous anno-
tation projects, it builds on existing resources and
lessons learned. For instance, CATiB’s pipeline
uses PATB-trained tools for tokenization, POS-
tagging and parsing. We also use the TrEd anno-
tation interface developed in coordination with the
PADT. Similarly, our annotation manual is guided
by the wonderfully detailed manual of the PATB
for coverage (Maamouri et al., 2008).

Annotators Our five annotators and their super-
visor are all educated native Arabic speakers. An-
notators are hired on a part-time basis and are not
required to be on-site. The annotation files are ex-
changed electronically. This arrangement allows
more annotators to participate, and reduces logis-
tical problems. However, having no full-time an-
notators limits the overall weekly annotation rate.
Annotator training took about two months (150
hrs/annotator on average). This training time is
much shorter than the PATB’s six-month training
period.4

Below, we describe our pipeline in some detail
including the different resources we use.

Data Preparation The data to annotate is split
into batches of 3-5 documents each, with each
document containing around 15-20 sentences
(400-600 tokens). Each annotator works on one
batch at a time. This procedure and the size
of the batches was determined to be optimal for
both the software and the annotators’ productivity.
To track the annotation quality, several key doc-
uments are selected for inter-annotator agreement
(IAA) checks. The IAA documents are chosen to

cover a range of sources and to be of average doc-
ument size. These documents (collectively about
10% of the token volume) are seeded throughout
the batches. Every annotator eventually annotates
each one of the IAA documents, but is never told
which documents are for IAA.

Automatic Tokenization and POS Tagging We
use the MADA&TOKAN toolkit (Habash and
Rambow, 2005) for initial tokenization and POS
tagging. The tokenization F-score is 99.1% and
the POS tagging accuracy (on the CATiB POS tag
set; with gold tokenization) is above 97.7%.

Manual Tokenization Correction Tokeniza-
tion decisions are manually checked and corrected
by the annotation supervisor. New POS tags are
assigned manually only for corrected tokens. Full
POS tag correction is done as part of the manual
annotation step (see below). The speed of this step
is well over 6K tokens/hour.

Automatic Parsing Initial dependency parsing
in CATiB is conducted using MaltParser (Nivre et
al., 2007). An initial parsing model was built using
an automatic constituency-to-dependency conver-
sion of a section of PATB part 3 (PATB3-Train,
339K tokens). The quality of the automatic con-
version step is measured against a hand-annotated
version of an automatically converted held-out
section of PATB3 (PATB3-Dev, 31K tokens). The
results are 87.2%, 93.16% and 83.2% for attach-
ment (ATT), label (LAB) and labeled attachment
(LABATT) accuracies, respectively. These num-
bers are 95%, 98% and 94% (respectively) of the
IAA scores on that set.5 At the production mid-
point another parsing model was trained by adding
all the CATiB annotations generated up to that
point (513K tokens total). An evaluation of the
parser against the CATiB version of PATB3-Dev
shows the ATT, LAB and LABATT accuracies
are 81.7%, 91.1% and 77.4% respectively.6

Manual Annotation CATiB uses the TrEd tool
as a visual interface for annotation.7 The parsed
trees are converted to TrEd format and delivered
to the annotators. The annotators are asked to only
correct the POS, syntactic structure and relation
labels. Once annotated (i.e. corrected), the docu-
ments are returned to be packaged for release.

5Conversion will be discussed in a future publication.
6Since CATiB POS tag set is rather small, we extend it

automatically deterministically to a larger tag set for parsing
purposes. Details will be presented in a future publication.

4 Results

Data Sets CATiB annotated data is taken
from the following LDC-provided resources:8
LDC2007E46, LDC2007E87, GALE-DEV07,
MT05 test set, MT06 test set, and PATB (part 3).
These datasets are 2004-2007 newswire feeds col-
lected from different news agencies and news pa-
pers, such as Agence France Presse, Xinhua, Al-
Hayat, Al-Asharq Al-Awsat, Al-Quds Al-Arabi,
An-Nahar, Al-Ahram and As-Sabah. The CATiB-
annotated PATB3 portion is extracted from An-
Nahar news articles from 2002. Headlines, date-
lines and bylines are not annotated and some sen-
tences are excluded for excessive (>300 tokens)
length and formatting problems. Over 273K to-
kens (228K words, 7,121 trees) of data were anno-
tated, not counting IAA duplications. In addition,
the PATB part 1, part 2 and part 3 data is automat-
ically converted into CATiB representation. This
converted data contributes an additional 735K to-
kens (613K words, 24,198 trees). Collectively, the
CATiB version 1.0 release contains over 1M to-
kens (841K words, 31,319 trees), including anno-
tated and converted data.

Annotator Speeds Our POS and syntax annota-
tion rate is 540 tokens/hour (with some reaching
rates as high as 715 tokens/hour). However, due
to the current part-time arrangement, annotators
worked an average of only 6 hours/week, which
meant that data was annotated at an average rate of
15K tokens/week. These speeds are much higher
than reported speeds for complete (POS+syntax)
annotation in PATB (around 250-300 tokens/hour)
and PADT (around 75 tokens/hour).9

Maamouri and Otakar Smrž. In the PATB, the syntactic anno-
tation step alone has similar speed to CATiB’s full POS and
syntax annotation. The POS annotation step is what slows
down the whole process in PATB.

subsets from two data sets in Table 1: PATB3-
Dev is based on an automatically converted PATB
set and PROD refers to all the new CATiB data.
We compare the IAA scores for all sentences and
for sentences of token length ≤ 40 tokens. The
IAA scores in PROD are lower than PATB3-Dev,
this is understandable given that the error rate of
the conversion from a manual annotation (starting
point of PATB3-Dev) is lower than parsing (start-
ing point for PROD). Length seems to make a big
difference in performance for PROD, but less so
for PATB3-Dev, which makes sense given their
origins. Annotation training did not include very
long sentences. Excluding long sentences during
production was not possible because the data has a
high proportion of very long sentences: for PROD
set, 41% of sentences had >40 tokens and they
constituted over 61% of all tokens.

The best reported IAA number for PATB
is 94.3% F-measure after extensive efforts
(Maamouri et al., 2008). This number does not in-
clude dashtags, empty categories or indices. Our
numbers cannot be directly compared to their
number because of the different metrics used for
different representations.

Serial Inter-Annotator Agreement We test the
value of serial annotation, a procedure in which
the output of annotation is passed again as input to
another annotator in an attempt to improve it. The
IAA documents with the highest (HI, 333 tokens)
and lowest (LO, 350 tokens) agreement scores in
PROD are selected. The results, shown in Table 2,
indicate that serial annotation is very helpful re-
ducing LABATT error by 20-50%. The reduction
in LO is not as large as that in HI, unfortunately.
The second round of annotation is almost twice as
fast as the first round. The overall reduction in
speed (end-to-end) is around 30%.

Disagreement Analysis We conduct an error
analysis of the basic-annotation disagreements in
HI and LO. The two sets differ in sentence length,
source and genre: HI has 28 tokens/sentence and
contains AFP general news, while LO has 58 to-

kens/sentence and contains Xinhua financial news.
The most common POS disagreement in both sets
is NOM/PROP confusion, a common issue in Ara-
bic POS tagging in general. The most common
attachment disagreements in LO are as follows:
prepositional phrase (PP) and nominal modifiers
(8% of the words had at least one dissenting an-
notation), complex constructions (dates, proper
nouns, numbers and currencies) (6%), subordina-
tion/coordination (4%), among others. The re-
spective proportions for HI are 5%, 5% and 1%.
Label disagreements are mostly in nominal modi-
fication (MOD/TMZ/IDF/—) (LO 10%, HI 5% of
the words had at least one dissenting annotation).

The error differences between HI and LO seem
to primarily correlate with length difference and
less with genre and source differences.

5 Conclusion and Future Work
We presented CATiB, a treebank for Arabic pars-
ing built with faster annotation speed in mind. In
the future, we plan to extend our annotation guide-
lines focusing on longer sentences and specific
complex constructions, introduce serial annotation
as a standard part of the annotation pipeline, and
enrich the treebank with automatically generated
morphological information.
