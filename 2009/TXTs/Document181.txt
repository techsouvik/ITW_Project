Abstract
Combining word alignments trained in
two translation directions has mostly re-
lied on heuristics that are not directly
motivated by intended applications. We
propose a novel method that performs
combination as an optimization process.
Our algorithm explicitly maximizes the ef-
fectiveness function with greedy search
for phrase table training or synchronized
grammar extraction. Experimental results
show that the proposed method leads to
significantly better translation quality than
existing methods. Analysis suggests that
this simple approach is able to maintain
accuracy while maximizing coverage.

1 Introduction

Word alignment is the process of identifying
word-to-word links between parallel sentences. It
is a fundamental and often a necessary step before
linguistic knowledge acquisitions, such as train-
ing a phrase translation table in phrasal machine
translation (MT) system (Koehn et al., 2003), or
extracting hierarchial phrase rules or synchronized
grammars in syntax-based translation framework.

Most word alignment models distinguish trans-
lation direction in deriving word alignment matrix.
Given a parallel sentence, word alignments in two
directions are established first, and then they are
combined as knowledge source for phrase train-
ing or rule extraction. This process is also called
symmetrization. It is a common practice in most
state of the art MT systems. Widely used align-
ment models, such as IBM Model serial (Brown
et al., 1993) and HMM , all assume one-to-many
alignments. Since many-to-many links are com-
monly observed in natural language, symmetriza-
tion is able to make up for this modeling limita-
tion. On the other hand, combining two direc-
tional alignments practically can lead to improved

performance. Symmetrization can also be real-
ized during alignment model training (Liang et al.,
2006; Zens et al., 2004).

Given two sets of word alignments trained in
two translation directions, two extreme combina-
tion are intersection and union. While intersec-
tion achieves high precision with low recall, union
is the opposite. A right balance of these two ex-
treme cases would offer a good coverage with rea-
sonable accuracy. So starting from intersection,
gradually adding elements in the union by heuris-
tics is typically used. Koehn et al. (2003) grow
the set of word links by appending neighboring
points, while Och and Hey (2003) try to avoid both
horizontal and vertical neighbors. These heuristic-
based combination methods are not driven explic-
itly by the intended application of the resulting
output. Ayan (2005) exploits many advanced ma-
chine learning techniques for general word align-
ment combination problem. However, human
annotation is required for supervised training in
those techniques.

We propose a new combination method. Like
heuristics, we aim to find a balance between in-
tersection and union. But unlike heuristics, com-
bination is carried out as an optimization process
driven by an effectiveness function. We evaluate
the impact of each alignment pair w.r.t. the target
application, say phrase table training, and gradu-
ally add or remove the word link that currently
can maximize the predicted benefit measured by
the effectiveness function. More specifically, we
consider the goal of word alignment combination
is for phrase table training, and we directly moti-
vate word alignment combination as a process of
maximizing the number of phrase translations that
can be extracted within a sentence pair.

2 Combination As Optimization Process

Given a parallel sentence (e = eI1, f = f
J
1 ), a

word link is represented by a pair of indices (i, j),

229



which means that Foreign word fj is aligned with
English word ei. The direction of word alignments
is ignored. Since the goal of word alignment com-
bination is for phrase table training, we first for-
mally define a phrase translation. Provided with
a set of static word alignments A, a phrase pair
(ei2i1 , f

j2
j1

) is considered translation of each other if
and only if there exists at least one word link be-
tween them and no cross phrase boundary links ex-
ist in A, i.e., for all (i, j) ∈ A, i ∈ [i1, i2] iff j ∈
[j1, j2]. Notice that by this definition, it does not
matter whether boundary words of the phrase pairs
should be aligned or not. Let PPn(A) denote the
set of phrase pairs that can be extracted with A
where up to n boundary words are allowed to be
not-aligned, i.e., aligned to empty word NULL. As
can be imagined, increasing n would improve re-
call of phrase table but likely to hurt precision. For
word alignment combination, we focus on the set
with high accuracy where n = 0.

Let A1, A2 denote two sets of word alignments
to be combined for the given sentence pair. For
instance, A1 could be word alignments from En-
glish to foreign while A2 the other direction. On
different setup, A1 could be Model-4 alignments,
while A2 is from HMM. In the first combination
method we presented in Algorithm 1, we start with
intersection AI . Ac is the candidate link set to be
evaluated and appended to the combined set A. Its
initial value is the difference between union and
intersection. We assume that there is an effective-
ness function g(·) which quantitatively measures
the ‘goodness’ of a alignment set for the intended
application. A higher number indicates a better
alignment set. We use the function g to drive the
process. Each time, we identify the best word link
(̂i, ĵ) in the candidate set that can maximize the
function g and append it to the current set A. This
process is repeated until the candidate set is empty
or adding any link in the set would lead to degra-
dation. Finally (line 15 to 21), we pickup word
links in the candidate set to align those uncov-
ered words. This is applied to maximize cover-
age, which is similar as the ‘final’ in (Koehn et al.,
2003). Again, we use the function g(·) to rank the
word links in Ac and sequentially append them to
A depending on current word coverage.

The algorithm clearly is a greedy search pro-
cedure that maximizes the function g. Since we
plan to take the combined word alignments for
phrase translation training, a natural choice for

g is the number of phrase pairs that can be ex-
tracted with the given alignment set. We choose
g(A) = |PP0(A)|, where we only count phrase
pairs that all boundary words are aligned. The
reason of putting a tight constraint is to maintain
phrase table accuracy while improving the cover-
age. By keeping track of the span of currently
aligned words, we can have efficient implemen-
tation of the function g.

Algorithm 1 Combination of A1 and A2 as an Optimized
Expanding Process

1: AI = A1 ∩A2, AU = A1 ∪A2
2: A = AI , Ac = AU −AI
3: total = g(A)
4: while Ac 6= ∅ do
5: curMax = max(i,j)∈Ac g(A ∪ {(i, j)})
6: if curMax ≥ total then
7: (̂i, ĵ) = argmax(i,j)∈Ac g(A ∪ {(i, j)})
8: A = A ∪ {(̂i, ĵ)}
9: Ac = Ac − {(̂i, ĵ)}

10: total = curMax
11: else {adding any link will make it worse}
12: break
13: end if
14: end while
15: while Ac 6= ∅ do
16: (̂i, ĵ) = argmax(i,j)∈Ac g(A ∪ {(i, j)})
17: if eî is not aligned or fĵ is not aligned then
18: A = A ∪ {(̂i, ĵ)}
19: end if
20: Ac = Ac − {(̂i, ĵ)}
21: end while
22: return A

Alternatively, the optimization can go in oppo-
site direction. We start with the union A = AU ,
and gradually remove the worse word link (̂i, ĵ) =
argmax(i,j)∈Ac g(A − {(i, j)}) that could max-
imize the effectiveness function. Similarly, this
shrinking process is repeated until either candidate
set is empty or removing any link in the candidate
set would reduce the value of function g.

Other choice of ‘goodness’ function g is pos-
sible. For instance, one could consider syntactic
constraints, or weight phrase pairs differently ac-
cording to their global co-occurrence. The basic
idea is to implement the combination as an itera-
tive customized optimization process that is driven
by the application.

3 Experimental Results

We test the proposed new idea on Persian Farsi to
English translation. The task is to translate spoken
Farsi into English. We decode reference transcrip-
tion so recognition is not an issue. The training

230



data was provided by the DARPA TransTac pro-
gram. It consists of around 110K sentence pairs
with 850K English words in the military force
protection domain. We train IBM Model-4 using
GIZA++ toolkit (Och and Ney, 2003) in two trans-
lation directions and perform different word align-
ment combination. The resulting alignment set is
used to train a phrase translation table, where Farsi
phrases are limited to up to 6 words.

The quality of resulting phrase translation table
is measured by translation results. Our decoder
is a phrase-based multi-stack implementation of
the log-linear model similar to Pharaoh (Koehn et
al., 2003). Like other log-linear model based de-
coders, active features in our translation engine in-
clude translation models in two directions, lexicon
weights in two directions, language model, lexi-
calized reordering models, sentence length penalty
and other heuristics. These feature weights are
tuned on the dev set to achieve optimal transla-
tion performance evaluated by automatic metric.
The language model is a statistical 4-gram model
estimated with Modified Kneser-Ney smoothing
(Chen and Goodman, 1996) using only English
sentences in the parallel training data.

3.1 Phrase Table Comparison

We first study the impact of different word align-
ment combination methods on phrase translation
table, and compare our approaches to heuristic
based methods. The same English to Farsi and
Farsi to English Model-4 word alignments are
used, but we try different combination methods
and analysis the final alignment set and the result-
ing phase translation table. Table 1 presents some
statistics. Each row corresponds to a particular
combination. The first two are intersection (I) and
union (U). The next two methods are heuristic (H)
in (Och and Ney, 2003) and grow-diagonal (GD)
proposed in (Koehn et al., 2003). Our proposed
methods are presented in the following two rows:
one is optimization as an expanding process (OE),
the other is optimization as an shrinking process
(OS). In the last four rows, we add ‘final’ opera-
tion (line 15 to 21 in Algorithm 1).

For each method, we calculate the output align-
ment set size as a percentage of the union (the
2nd column) and resulting phrase table (PPn(A))
size (in thousand) with different constrain on the
maximum number of unaligned boundary words
n = 0, 1, 2 (the next 3 columns). As we can

see, the intersection has less than half of all word
links in the pool. This implies the underlying word
alignment quality leaves much room for improve-
ments, mainly due to data sparseness. Not sur-
prisingly, when relaxing unaligned boundary word
number from 0 to 2, the phrase table size increases
more than 7 times. This is the result of very low
recall of word alignments, consequently the esti-
mated phrase table PP2(A) has very low accu-
racy. Union suffers from the opposite problem:
many incorrect word links prevent good phrase
pairs from being extracted.

The two heuristic methods and our proposed
optimization approaches achieve somewhat a bal-
ance between I and U. By comparing size of
PP0(A) (3rd column), optimization methods are
able to identify much more phrase pairs with sim-
ilar size of alignment set. This confirms that the
new method is indeed moving to the desired di-
rection of extracting as many accurate (all bound-
ary words should be aligned) phrase pairs as pos-
sible. We still notice that ratio of |PP2(A)| and
|PP0(A)| (the last column) is high. We suspect
that the ratio of this two phrase table size might
somewhat be indicative of the phrase table accu-
racy, which is hard to estimate without manual an-
notation though.

Method |A||AU | |PP0| |PP1| |PP2|

I 45% 424 2047 3658 8.63
U 100% 354 555 578 1.63
H 78% 538 1225 1519 2.82
GD 82% 499 1081 1484 2.97

OEF 89% 476 739 768 1.61

3.2 Translation Results

The ultimate goal of word alignment combination
is for building translation system. The quality of
resulting phrase tables is measured by automatic
translation metric. We have one dev set (1430 sen-
tences with 11483 running words), test set 1 (1390
sentences with 10334 running words) and test set
2 (417 sentences with 4239 running words). The
dev set and test set 1 are part of all available Farsi-

231



English parallel corpus. They are holdout from
training data as tuning and testing. The test set 2
is the standard NIST offline evaluation set, where
4 references are available for each sentence. The
dev and test set 1 are much closer to the training
set than the standard test set 2. We tune all fea-
ture weights automatically (Och, 2003) to maxi-
mize the BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) score on
the dev set.

Table 2 shows BLEU score of different com-
bination methods on all three sets. Union per-
forms much worse on the dev and test1 than inter-
section, while intersection achieved the same per-
formance on test2 as union but with more than 6
times of phrase table size. Grow-diagonal (GD)
has more than 1 bleu point on test2 than intersec-
tion but with less than half of phrase table size.
The proposed new method OE is consistently bet-
ter than both heuristic methods GD and H, with
more than 1 point on dev/teset1 and 0.7 point on
test2. Comparing the last group to the middle one,
we can see the effect of the ‘final’ operation on
all four methods. Tabel 1 shows that after apply-
ing the final operation, phrase table size is cut into
half. When evaluated with automatic translation
metric, all four methods generally perform much
worse on dev and test1 that are close to training
data, but better on NIST standard test2. We ob-
serve half BLEU point improvement for optimiza-
tion method but marginal gain for heuristic-based
approaches. This suggest that the phrase table ac-
curacy get improved with the final operation. Op-
timization method directly tries to maximize the
number of phrase pairs that can be extracted. We
observe that it (OEF) is able to find more than
14% more phrase pairs than heuristic methods and
achieve 1 BLEU point gain than the best heuristic
method (GDF).

4 Conclusions

We presented a simple yet effective method for
word alignment symmetrization and combination
in general. The problem is formulated as an opti-
mization with greedy search driven by an effec-
tiveness function, which can be customized di-
rectly to maximum benefit for intended applica-
tions such as phrase table training or synchronized
grammar extraction in machine translation. Ex-
perimental results demonstrated consistent better
BLEU scores than the best heuristic method. The
optimization process can better maintain accuracy
while improving coverage.

The algorithm is generic and leaves much space
for variations. For instance, designing a better ef-
fectiveness function g, or considering a soft link
with some probability rather than binary 0/1 con-
nection would potentially be opportunities for fur-
ther improvement. On the other hand, the search
space of current algorithm is limited by the pool
of candidate set, it is possible to suggest new links
while driven by the target function.
