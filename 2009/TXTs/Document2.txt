Abstract

In this paper, we present a new learning
scenario, heterogeneous transfer learn-
ing, which improves learning performance
when the data can be in different feature
spaces and where no correspondence be-
tween data instances in these spaces is pro-
vided. In the past, we have classified Chi-
nese text documents using English train-
ing data under the heterogeneous trans-
fer learning framework. In this paper,
we present image clustering as an exam-
ple to illustrate how unsupervised learning
can be improved by transferring knowl-
edge from auxiliary heterogeneous data
obtained from the social Web. Image
clustering is useful for image sense dis-
ambiguation in query-based image search,
but its quality is often low due to image-
data sparsity problem. We extend PLSA
to help transfer the knowledge from social
Web data, which have mixed feature repre-
sentations. Experiments on image-object
clustering and scene clustering tasks show
that our approach in heterogeneous trans-
fer learning based on the auxiliary data is
indeed effective and promising.

1 Introduction

Traditional machine learning relies on the avail-
ability of a large amount of data to train a model,
which is then applied to test data in the same
feature space. However, labeled data are often
scarce and expensive to obtain. Various machine
learning strategies have been proposed to address
this problem, including semi-supervised learning
(Zhu, 2007), domain adaptation (Wu and Diet-
terich, 2004; Blitzer et al., 2006; Blitzer et al.,
2007; Arnold et al., 2007; Chan and Ng, 2007;
Daume, 2007; Jiang and Zhai, 2007; Reichart

and Rappoport, 2007; Andreevskaia and Bergler,
2008), multi-task learning (Caruana, 1997; Re-
ichart et al., 2008; Arnold et al., 2008), self-taught
learning (Raina et al., 2007), etc. A commonality
among these methods is that they all require the
training data and test data to be in the same fea-
ture space. In addition, most of them are designed
for supervised learning. However, in practice, we
often face the problem where the labeled data are
scarce in their own feature space, whereas there
may be a large amount of labeled heterogeneous
data in another feature space. In such situations, it
would be desirable to transfer the knowledge from
heterogeneous data to domains where we have rel-
atively little training data available.

To learn from heterogeneous data, researchers
have previously proposed multi-view learning
(Blum and Mitchell, 1998; Nigam and Ghani,
2000) in which each instance has multiple views in
different feature spaces. Different from previous
works, we focus on the problem of heterogeneous
transfer learning, which is designed for situation
when the training data are in one feature space
(such as text), and the test data are in another (such
as images), and there may be no correspondence
between instances in these spaces. The type of
heterogeneous data can be very different, as in the
case of text and image. To consider how hetero-
geneous transfer learning relates to other types of
learning, Figure 1 presents an intuitive illustration
of four learning strategies, including traditional
machine learning, transfer learning across differ-
ent distributions, multi-view learning and hetero-
geneous transfer learning. As we can see, an
important distinguishing feature of heterogeneous
transfer learning, as compared to other types of
learning, is that more constraints on the problem
are relaxed, such that data instances do not need to
correspond anymore. This allows, for example, a
collection of Chinese text documents to be classi-
fied using another collection of English text as the

1



training data (c.f. (Ling et al., 2008) and Section
2.1).

In this paper, we will give an illustrative exam-
ple of heterogeneous transfer learning to demon-
strate how the task of image clustering can ben-
efit from learning from the heterogeneous social
Web data. A major motivation of our work is
Web-based image search, where users submit tex-
tual queries and browse through the returned result
pages. One problem is that the user queries are of-
ten ambiguous. An ambiguous keyword such as
“Apple” might retrieve images of Apple comput-
ers and mobile phones, or images of fruits. Im-
age clustering is an effective method for improv-
ing the accessibility of image search result. Loeff
et al. (2006) addressed the image clustering prob-
lem with a focus on image sense discrimination.
In their approach, images associated with textual
features are used for clustering, so that the text
and images are clustered at the same time. Specif-
ically, spectral clustering is applied to the distance
matrix built from a multimodal feature set associ-
ated with the images to get a better feature repre-
sentation. This new representation contains both
image and text information, with which the per-
formance of image clustering is shown to be im-
proved. A problem with this approach is that when
images contained in the Web search results are
very scarce and when the textual data associated
with the images are very few, clustering on the im-
ages and their associated text may not be very ef-
fective.

Different from these previous works, in this pa-
per, we address the image clustering problem as
a heterogeneous transfer learning problem. We
aim to leverage heterogeneous auxiliary data, so-
cial annotations, etc. to enhance image cluster-
ing performance. We observe that the World Wide
Web has many annotated images in Web sites such
as Flickr (http://www.flickr.com), which
can be used as auxiliary information source for
our clustering task. In this work, our objective
is to cluster a small collection of images that we
are interested in, where these images are not suf-
ficient for traditional clustering algorithms to per-
form well due to data sparsity and the low level of
image features. We investigate how to utilize the
readily available socially annotated image data on
the Web to improve image clustering. Although
these auxiliary data may be irrelevant to the im-
ages to be clustered and cannot be directly used

to solve the data sparsity problem, we show that
they can still be used to estimate a good latent fea-
ture representation, which can be used to improve
image clustering.

2.1 Heterogeneous Transfer Learning
Between Languages

In this section, we summarize our previous work
on cross-language classification as an example of
heterogeneous transfer learning. This example
is related to our image clustering problem be-
cause they both rely on data from different feature
spaces.

As the World Wide Web in China grows rapidly,
it has become an increasingly important prob-
lem to be able to accurately classify Chinese Web
pages. However, because the labeled Chinese Web
pages are still not sufficient, we often find it diffi-
cult to achieve high accuracy by applying tradi-
tional machine learning algorithms to the Chinese
Web pages directly. Would it be possible to make
the best use of the relatively abundant labeled En-
glish Web pages for classifying the Chinese Web
pages?

To answer this question, in (Ling et al., 2008),
we developed a novel approach for classifying the
Web pages in Chinese using the training docu-
ments in English. In this subsection, we give a
brief summary of this work. The problem to be
solved is: we are given a collection of labeled
English documents and a large number of unla-
beled Chinese documents. The English and Chi-
nese texts are not aligned. Our objective is to clas-
sify the Chinese documents into the same label
space as the English data.

Our key observation is that even though the data
use different text features, they may still share
many of the same semantic information. What we
need to do is to uncover this latent semantic in-
formation by finding out what is common among
them. We did this in (Ling et al., 2008) by us-
ing the information bottleneck theory (Tishby et
al., 1999). In our work, we first translated the
Chinese document into English automatically us-
ing some available translation software, such as
Google translate. Then, we encoded the training
text as well as the translated target text together,
in terms of the information theory. We allowed all
the information to be put through a ‘bottleneck’
and be represented by a limited number of code-

words (i.e. labels in the classification problem).
Finally, information bottleneck was used to main-
tain most of the common information between the
two data sources, and discard the remaining irrel-
evant information. In this way, we can approxi-
mate the ideal situation where similar training and
translated test pages shared in the common part are
encoded into the same codewords, and are thus as-
signed the correct labels. In (Ling et al., 2008), we
experimentally showed that heterogeneous trans-
fer learning can indeed improve the performance
of cross-language text classification as compared
to directly training learning models (e.g., Naive
Bayes or SVM) and testing on the translated texts.

2.2 Other Works in Transfer Learning

In the past, several other works made use of trans-
fer learning for cross-feature-space learning. Wu
and Oard (2008) proposed to handle the cross-
language learning problem by translating the data
into a same language and applying kNN on the
latent topic space for classification. Most learning
algorithms for dealing with cross-language hetero-
geneous data require a translator to convert the
data to the same feature space. For those data that
are in different feature spaces where no transla-
tor is available, Davis and Domingos (2008) pro-
posed a Markov-logic-based transfer learning al-
gorithm, which is called deep transfer, for trans-
ferring knowledge between biological domains
and Web domains. Dai et al. (2008a) proposed

a novel learning paradigm, known as translated
learning, to deal with the problem of learning het-
erogeneous data that belong to quite different fea-
ture spaces by using a risk minimization frame-
work.

2.3 Relation to PLSA

Our work makes use of PLSA. Probabilistic la-
tent semantic analysis (PLSA) is a widely used
probabilistic model (Hofmann, 1999), and could
be considered as a probabilistic implementation of
latent semantic analysis (LSA) (Deerwester et al.,
1990). An extension to PLSA was proposed in
(Cohn and Hofmann, 2000), which incorporated
the hyperlink connectivity in the PLSA model by
using a joint probabilistic model for connectivity
and content. Moreover, PLSA has shown a lot
of applications ranging from text clustering (Hof-
mann, 2001) to image analysis (Sivic et al., 2005).

2.4 Relation to Clustering

Compared to many previous works on image clus-
tering, we note that traditional image cluster-
ing is generally based on techniques such as K-
means (MacQueen, 1967) and hierarchical clus-
tering (Kaufman and Rousseeuw, 1990). How-
ever, when the data are sparse, traditional clus-
tering algorithms may have difficulties in obtain-
ing high-quality image clusters. Recently, several
researchers have investigated how to leverage the
auxiliary information to improve target clustering

3



performance, such as supervised clustering (Fin-
ley and Joachims, 2005), semi-supervised cluster-
ing (Basu et al., 2004), self-taught clustering (Dai
et al., 2008b), etc.

3 Image Clustering with Annotated
Auxiliary Data

In this section, we present our annotation-based
probabilistic latent semantic analysis algorithm
(aPLSA), which extends the traditional PLSA
model by incorporating annotated auxiliary im-
age data. Intuitively, our algorithm aPLSA per-
forms PLSA analysis on the target images, which
are converted to an image instance-to-feature co-
occurrence matrix. At the same time, PLSA is
also applied to the annotated image data from so-
cial Web, which is converted into a text-to-image-
feature co-occurrence matrix. In order to unify
those two separate PLSA models, these two steps
are done simultaneously with common latent vari-
ables used as a bridge linking them. Through
these common latent variables, which are now
constrained by both target image data and auxil-
iary annotation data, a better clustering result is
expected for the target data.

3.1 Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis

Let F = {fi}
|F|
i=1 be an image feature space, and

V = {vi}
|V|
i=1 be the image data set. Each image

vi ∈ V is represented by a bag-of-features {f |f ∈
vi ∧ f ∈ F}.

Based on the image data set V , we can esti-
mate an image instance-to-feature co-occurrence
matrix A|V|×|F| ∈ R|V|×|F|, where each element
Aij (1 ≤ i ≤ |V| and 1 ≤ j ≤ |F|) in the matrix
A is the frequency of the feature fj appearing in
the instance vi.

LetW = {wi}
|W|
i=1 be a text feature space. The

annotated image data allow us to obtain the co-
occurrence information between images v and text
features w ∈ W . An example of annotated im-
age data is the Flickr (http://www.flickr.
com), which is a social Web site containing a large
number of annotated images.

By extracting image features from the annotated
images v, we can estimate a text-to-image fea-
ture co-occurrence matrix B|W|×|F| ∈ R|W|×|F|,
where each element Bij (1 ≤ i ≤ |W| and
1 ≤ j ≤ |F|) in the matrix B is the frequency
of the text feature wi and the image feature fj oc-
curring together in the annotated image data set.

LetZ = {zi}
|Z|
i=1 be the latent variable set in our

aPLSA model. In clustering, each latent variable
zi ∈ Z corresponds to a certain cluster.

Our objective is to estimate a clustering func-
tion g : V 7→ Z with the help of the two co-
occurrence matrices A and B as defined above.

To formally introduce the aPLSA model, we
start from the probabilistic latent semantic anal-
ysis (PLSA) (Hofmann, 1999) model. PLSA is
a probabilistic implementation of latent seman-
tic analysis (LSA) (Deerwester et al., 1990). In
our image clustering task, PLSA decomposes the
instance-feature co-occurrence matrix A under the
assumption of conditional independence of image
instances V and image features F , given the latent
variables Z .

P (f |v) =
∑

z∈Z

P (f |z)P (z|v). (1)

The graphical model representation of PLSA is
shown in Figure 2.
Based on the PLSA model, the log-likelihood can
be defined as:

L =
∑

i

∑

j

Aij
∑

j′ Aij′
log P (fj |vi) (2)

where A|V|×|F| ∈ R|V|×|F| is the image instance-
feature co-occurrence matrix. The term

Aij
P

j′
Aij′

in Equation (2) is a normalization term ensuring
each image is giving the same weight in the log-
likelihood.

Using EM algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977),
which locally maximizes the log-likelihood of
the PLSA model (Equation (2)), the probabilities
P (f |z) and P (z|v) can be estimated. Then, the
clustering function is derived as

g(v) = argmax
z∈Z

P (z|v). (3)

Due to space limitation, we omit the details for the
PLSA model, which can be found in (Hofmann,
1999).

3.2 aPLSA: Annotation-based PLSA

In this section, we consider how to incorporate
a large number of socially annotated images in a

unified PLSA model for the purpose of utilizing
the correlation between text features and image
features. In the auxiliary data, each image has cer-
tain textual tags that are attached by users. The
correlation between text features and image fea-
tures can be formulated as follows.

P (f |w) =
∑

z∈Z

P (f |z)P (z|w). (4)

It is clear that Equations (1) and (4) share a same
term P (f |z). So we design a new PLSA model by
joining the probabilistic model in Equation (1) and
the probabilistic model in Equation (4) into a uni-
fied model, as shown in Figure 3. In Figure 3, the
latent variables Z depend not only on the corre-
lation between image instances V and image fea-
tures F , but also the correlation between text fea-
turesW and image featuresF . Therefore, the aux-
iliary socially-annotated image data can be used
to help the target image clustering performance by
estimating good set of latent variables Z .

Based on the graphical model representation in
Figure 3, we derive the log-likelihood objective
function, in a similar way as in (Cohn and Hof-
mann, 2000), as follows

L =

where A|V|×|F| ∈ R|V|×|F| is the image instance-
feature co-occurrence matrix, and B|W|×|F| ∈
R
|W|×|F| is the text-to-image feature-level co-

occurrence matrix. Similar to Equation (2),
Aij

P

and
Blj

in Equation (5) are the nor-

malization terms to prevent imbalanced cases.
Furthermore, λ acts as a trade-off parameter be-

tween the co-occurrence matrices A and B. In
the extreme case when λ = 1, the log-likelihood
objective function ignores all the biases from the

text-to-image occurrence matrix B. In this case,
the aPLSA model degenerates to the traditional
PLSA model. Therefore, aPLSA is an extension
to the PLSA model.

Now, the objective is to maximize the log-
likelihood L of the aPLSA model in Equation (5).
Then we apply the EM algorithm (Dempster et
al., 1977) to estimate the conditional probabilities
P (f |z), P (z|w) and P (z|v) with respect to each
dependence in Figure 3 as follows.

• E-Step: calculate the posterior probability of
each latent variable z given the observation
of image features f , image instances v and
text features w based on the old estimate of
P (f |z), P (z|w) and P (z|v):

P (zk|vi, fj) =
P (fj |zk)P (zk|vi)

∑

k′ P (fj |zk′)P (zk′ |vi)

(6)

P (zk|wl, fj) =
P (fj |zk)P (zk|wl)

∑

k′ P (fj |zk′)P (zk′ |wl)

(7)

• M-Step: re-estimates conditional probabili-
ties P (zk|vi) and P (zk|wl):

P (zk|vi) =
∑

j

Aij
∑

j′ Aij′
P (zk|vi, fj) (8)

P (zk|wl) =
∑

j

Blj
∑

j′ Blj′
P (zk|wl, fj) (9)

and conditional probability P (fj |zk), which
is a mixture portion of posterior probability
of latent variables

P (fj |zk) ∝ λ

j′ Aij′
P (zk|vi, fj)

+ (1− λ)
∑

Blj
∑

P (zk|wl, fj)

(10)

Finally, the clustering function for a certain im-
age v is

g(v) = argmax
z∈Z

P (z|v). (11)

From the above equations, we can derive
our annotation-based probabilistic latent semantic
analysis (aPLSA) algorithm. As shown in Algo-
rithm 1, aPLSA iteratively performs the E-Step
and the M-Step in order to seek local optimal
points based on the objective function L in Equa-
tion (5).

4 Experiments

In this section, we empirically evaluate the aPLSA
algorithm together with some state-of-art base-
line methods on two widely used image corpora,
to demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm
aPLSA.

4.1 Data Sets

In order to evaluate the effectiveness of our algo-
rithm aPLSA, we conducted experiments on sev-
eral data sets generated from two image corpora,
Caltech-256 (Griffin et al., 2007) and the fifteen-
scene (Lazebnik et al., 2006). The Caltech-256
data set has 256 image objective categories, rang-
ing from animals to buildings, from plants to au-
tomobiles, etc. The fifteen-scene data set con-
tains 15 scenes such as store and forest.
From these two corpora, we randomly generated
eleven image clustering tasks, including seven 2-
way clustering tasks, two 4-way clustering task,
one 5-way clustering task and one 8-way cluster-
ing task. The detailed descriptions for these clus-
tering tasks are given in Table 1. In these tasks,
bi7 and oct1 were generated from fifteen-scene
data set, and the rest were from Caltech-256 data
set.

these data sets, bi7 and oct1 were generated
from fifteen-scene data set, and the rest were from
Caltech-256 data set.

To empirically investigate the parameter λ and
the convergence of our algorithm aPLSA, we gen-
erated five more date sets as the development sets.
The detailed description of these five development
sets, namely tune1 to tune5 is listed in Table 1
as well.

The auxiliary data were crawled from the Flickr
(http://www.flickr.com/) web site dur-
ing August 2007. Flickr is an internet community
where people share photos online and express their
opinions as social tags (annotations) attached to
each image. From Flicker, we collected 19, 959
images and 91, 719 related annotations, among
which 2, 600 words are distinct. Based on the
method described in Section 3, we estimated the
co-occurrence matrix B between text features and
image features. This co-occurrence matrix B was
used by all the clustering tasks in our experiments.

For data preprocessing, we adopted the bag-of-
features representation of images (Li and Perona,
2005) in our experiments. Interesting points were
found in the images and described via the SIFT
descriptors (Lowe, 2004). Then, the interesting
points were clustered to generate a codebook to
form an image feature space. The size of code-
book was set to 2, 000 in our experiments. Based
on the codebook, which serves as the image fea-
ture space, each image can be represented as a cor-
responding feature vector to be used in the next
step.

To set our evaluation criterion, we used the

sociated with a random variable. In our prob-
lem, entropy serves as a measure of randomness
of clustering result. The entropy of g on a sin-
gle latent variable z is defined to be H(g, z) ,
−

∑

c∈C P (c|z) log2 P (c|z), where C is the class

label set of V and P (c|z) = |{v|g(v)=z∧t(v)=c}|
|{v|g(v)=z}|

,
in which t(v) is the true class label of image v.
Lower entropy H(g,Z) indicates less randomness
and thus better clustering result.

4.2 Empirical Analysis

We now empirically analyze the effectiveness of
our aPLSA algorithm. Because, to our best of
knowledge, few existing methods addressed the
problem of image clustering with the help of so-
cial annotation image data, we can only compare
our aPLSA with several state-of-the-art cluster-
ing algorithms that are not directly designed for
our problem. The first baseline is the well-known
KMeans algorithm (MacQueen, 1967). Since our
algorithm is designed based on PLSA (Hofmann,
1999), we also included PLSA for clustering as a
baseline method in our experiments.

For each of the above two baselines, we have
two strategies: (1) separated: the baseline
method was applied on the target image data only;
(2) combined: the baseline method was applied
to cluster the combined data consisting of both
target image data and the annotated image data.
Clustering results on target image data were used
for evaluation. Note that, in the combined data, all
the annotations were thrown away since baseline
methods evaluated in this paper do not leverage
annotation information.

In addition, we compared our algorithm aPLSA

to a state-of-the-art transfer clustering strategy,
known as self-taught clustering (STC) (Dai et al.,
2008b). STC makes use of auxiliary data to esti-
mate a better feature representation to benefit the
target clustering. In these experiments, the anno-
tated image data were used as auxiliary data in
STC, which does not use the annotation text.

In our experiments, the performance is in the
form of the average entropy and variance of five
repeats by randomly selecting 50 images from
each of the categories. We selected only 50 im-
ages per category, since this paper is focused on
clustering sparse data. Table 2 shows the perfor-
mance with respect to all comparison methods on
each of the image clustering tasks measured by
the entropy criterion. From the tables, we can see
that our algorithm aPLSA outperforms the base-
line methods in all the data sets. We believe that is
because aPLSA can effectively utilize the knowl-
edge from the socially annotated image data. On
average, aPLSA gives rise to 21.8% of entropy re-
duction and as compared to KMeans, 5.7% of en-
tropy reduction as compared to PLSA, and 10.1%
of entropy reduction as compared to STC.

4.2.1 Varying Data Size

We now show how the data size affects aPLSA,
with two baseline methods KMeans and PLSA as
reference. The experiments were conducted on
different amounts of target image data, varying
from 10 to 80. The corresponding experimental
results in average entropy over all the 11 clustering
tasks are shown in Figure 4(a). From this figure,
we observe that aPLSA always yields a significant
reduction in entropy as compared with two base-
line methods KMeans and PLSA, regardless of the
size of target image data that we used.

trade-off parameter λ.

4.2.2 Parameter Sensitivity
In aPLSA, there is a trade-off parameter λ that af-
fects how the algorithm relies on auxiliary data.
When λ = 0, the aPLSA relies only on annotated
image data B. When λ = 1, aPLSA relies only
on target image data A, in which case aPLSA de-
generates to PLSA. Smaller λ indicates heavier re-
liance on the annotated image data. We have done
some experiments on the development sets to in-
vestigate how different λ affect the performance
of aPLSA. We set the number of images per cate-
gory to 50, and tested the performance of aPLSA.
The result in average entropy over all development
sets is shown in Figure 4(b). In the experiments
described in this paper, we set λ to 0.2, which is
the best point in Figure 4(b).

4.2.3 Convergence
In our experiments, we tested the convergence
property of our algorithm aPLSA as well. Fig-
ure 4(c) shows the average entropy curve given
by aPLSA over all development sets. From this
figure, we see that the entropy decreases very fast
during the first 100 iterations and becomes stable
after 150 iterations. We believe that 200 iterations
is sufficient for aPLSA to converge.

5 Conclusions
In this paper, we proposed a new learning scenario
called heterogeneous transfer learning and illus-
trated its application to image clustering. Image
clustering, a vital component in organizing search
results for query-based image search, was shown
to be improved by transferring knowledge from
unrelated images with annotations in a social Web.
This is done by first learning the high-quality la-
tent variables in the auxiliary data, and then trans-
ferring this knowledge to help improve the cluster-
ing of the target image data. We conducted experi-

ments on two image data sets, using the Flickr data
as the annotated auxiliary image data, and showed
that our aPLSA algorithm can greatly outperform
several state-of-the-art clustering algorithms.

In natural language processing, there are many
future opportunities to apply heterogeneous trans-
fer learning. In (Ling et al., 2008) we have shown
how to classify the Chinese text using English text
as the training data. We may also consider cluster-
ing, topic modeling, question answering, etc., to
be done using data in different feature spaces. We
can consider data in different modalities, such as
video, image and audio, as the training data. Fi-
nally, we will explore the theoretical foundations
and limitations of heterogeneous transfer learning
as well.
