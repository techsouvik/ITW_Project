Abstract

This paper introduces the concepts of ask-
ing point and expected answer type as vari-
ations of the question focus. They are of
particular importance for QA over semi-
structured data, as represented by Topic
Maps, OWL or custom XML formats.
We describe an approach to the identifica-
tion of the question focus from questions
asked to a Question Answering system
over Topic Maps by extracting the asking
point and falling back to the expected an-
swer type when necessary. We use known
machine learning techniques for expected
answer type extraction and we implement
a novel approach to the asking point ex-
traction. We also provide a mathematical
model to predict the performance of the
system.

1 Introduction

Topic Maps is an ISO standard1 for knowledge
representation and information integration. It pro-
vides the ability to store complex meta-data to-
gether with the data itself.

This work addresses domain portable Question
Answering (QA) over Topic Maps. That is, a QA
system capable of retrieving answers to a question
asked against one particular topic map or topic
maps collection at a time. We concentrate on an
empirical approach to extract the question focus.
The extracted focus is then anchored to a topic
map construct. This way, we map the type of the
answer as provided in the question to the type of
the answer as available in the source data.

Our system runs over semi-structured data that
encodes ontological information. The classifica-
tion scheme we propose is based on one dynamic

1ISO/IEC 13250:2003,
http://www.isotopicmaps.org/sam/

and one static layer, contrasting with previous
work that uses static taxonomies (Li and Roth,
2002).

We use the term asking point or AP when the
type of the answer is explicit, e.g. the word
operas in the question What operas did Puccini
write?

We use the term expected answer type or EAT
when the type of the answer is implicit but can be
deduced from the question using formal methods.
The question Who composed Tosca? implies that
the answer is a person. That is, person is the ex-
pected answer type.

We consider that AP takes precedence over the
EAT. That is, if the AP (the explicit focus) has
been successfully identified in the question, it is
considered to be the type of the question, and the
EAT (the implicit focus) is left aside.

The claim that the exploitation of AP yields bet-
ter results in QA over Topic Maps has been tested
with 100 questions over the Italian Opera topic
map 2. AP, EAT and the answers of the ques-
tions were manually annotated. The answers to the
questions were annotated as topic map constructs
(i.e. as topics or as occurrences).

An evaluation for QA over Topic Maps has been
devised that has shown that choosing APs as foci
leads to a much better recall and precision. A de-
tailed description of this test is beyond the scope
of this paper.

2 System Architecture

We approach both AP and EAT extraction with
the same machine learning technology based on
the principle of maximum entropy (Ratnaparkhi,
1998)3.

Table 2: Distribution of AP classes (word level)

We annotated a corpus of 2100 questions. 1500
of those questions come from the Li & Roth cor-
pus (Li and Roth, 2002), 500 questions were taken
from the TREC-10 questions and 100 questions
were asked over the Italian Opera topic map.

2.1 AP extraction

We propose a model for extracting AP that is based
on word tagging. As opposed to EAT, AP is con-
structed on word level not on the question level.
Table 1 provides an annotated example of AP.

Our annotation guidelines limit the AP to the
noun phrase that is expected to be the type of the
answer. As such, it is different from the notion
of focus as a noun likely to be present in the an-
swer (Ferret et al., 2001) or as what the question
is all about (Moldovan et al., 1999). For instance,
a question such as Where is the Taj Mahal? does
not yield any AP. Although the main topic is the
Taj Mahal, the answer is not expected to be in a
parent-child relationship with the subject. Instead,
the sought after type is the EAT class LOCATION.
This distinction is important for QA over semi-
structured data where the data itself is likely to be
hierarchically organized.

Asking points were annotated in 1095 (52%)
questions out of 2100. The distribution of AP
classes in the annotated data is shown in the Ta-
ble 2.

A study of the inter-annotator agreement be-
tween two human annotators has been performed
on a set of 100 questions. The Cohen’s kappa
coefficient (Cohen, 1960) was at 0.781, which
is lower than the same measure for the inter-
annotator agreement on EAT. This is an expected
result, as the AP annotation is naturally perceived
as a more complex task. Nevertheless, this allows
to qualify the inter-annotator agreement as good.

For each word, a number of features were used

for EAT and AP extraction.

Class Count %
TIME 136 6.5%
NUMERIC 215 10.2%
DEFINITION 281 13.4%
LOCATION 329 15.7%
HUMAN 420 20.0%
OTHER 719 34.2%

by the classifier, including strings and POS-tags
on a 4-word window. The WH-word and its com-
plement were also used as features, as well as the
parsed subject of the question and the first nominal
phrase.

A simple rule-based AP extraction has also been
implemented, for comparison. It operates by re-
trieving the WH-complement from the syntactic
parse of the question and stripping the initial arti-
cles and numerals, to match the annotation guide-
lines for AP.

2.2 EAT extraction

EAT was supported by a taxonomy of 6 coarse
classes: HUMAN, NUMERIC, TIME, LOCA-
TION, DEFINITION and OTHER. This selection
is fairly close to the MUC typology of Named
Entities4 which has been the basis of numerous
feature-driven classifiers because of salient formal
indices that help identify the correct class.

We purposely limited the number of EAT
classes to 6 as AP extraction already provides
a fine-grained, dynamic classification from the
question to drive the subsequent search in the topic
map.

The distribution of EAT classes in the annotated
data is shown in the Table 3.

A study of the inter-annotator agreement be-
tween two human annotators has been performed
on a set of 200 questions. The resulting Cohen’s
kappa coefficient (Cohen, 1960) of 0.8858 allows
to qualify the inter-annotator agreement as very
good.

We followed Li & Roth (Li and Roth, 2002)
to implement the features for the EAT classifier.
They included strings and POS-tags, as well as
syntactic parse information (WH-words and their
complements, auxiliaries, subjects). Four lists for

words related to locations, people, quantities and
time were derived from WordNet and encoded as
semantic features.

3 Evaluation Results

The performance of the classifiers was evaluated
on our corpus of 2100 questions annotated for AP
and EAT. The corpus was split into 80% of training
and 20% test data, and data re-sampled 10 times in
order to account for variance.

Table 4 lists the figures for the accuracy of the
classifiers, that is, the ratio between the correct in-
stances and the overall number of instances. As
the AP classifier operates on words while the EAT
classifier operates on questions, we had to estimate
the accuracy of the AP classifier per question, to
allow for comparison. Two simple metrics are pos-
sible. A lenient metric assumes that the AP extrac-
tor performed correctly in the question if there is
an overlap between the system output and the an-
notation on the question level. An exact metric as-
sumes that the AP extractor performed correctly if
there is an exact match between the system output
and the annotation.

In the example What are Italian Operas? (Ta-
ble 1), assuming the system only tagged operas as
AP, lenient accuracy will be 1, exact accuracy will
be 0, precision for the AskingPoint class will be 1
and its recall will be 0.5.

Table 5 shows EAT results by class. Tables 6
and 7 show AP results by class for the machine
learning and the rule-based classifier.

As shown in Figure 1, when AP classification is
available it is used. During the evaluation, AP was
found in 49.4% of questions.

A mathematical model has been devised to pre-
dict the accuracy of the focus extractor on an an-
notated corpus.

It is expected that the focus accuracy, that is, the
accuracy of the focus extraction system, is depen-
dent on the performance of the AP and the EAT
classifiers. Given N the total number of questions,

Table 7: Rule-based AP performance by class

we define the branching factor, that is, the percent-
age of questions for which AP is provided by the
system, as follows:

Y =
(TPAP + FPAP )

N

Figure 1 shows that the sum AP true posi-
tives and EAT correct classifications represents the
overall number of questions that were classified
correctly. This accuracy can be further developed
to present the dependencies as follows:

AFOCUS = PAP Y + AEAT (1− Y )

That is, the overall accuracy is dependent on the
precision of the AskingPoint class of the AP clas-
sifier, the accuracy of EAT and the branching fac-
tor. The branching factor itself can be predicted
using the performance of the AP classifier and the
ratio between the number of questions annotated
with AP and the total number of questions.

4 Related work

(Atzeni et al., 2004; Paggio et al., 2004) describe
MOSES, a multilingual QA system delivering an-
swers from Topic Maps. MOSES extracts a focus
constraint (defined after (Rooth, 1992)) as part of
the question analysis, which is evaluated to an ac-
curacy of 76% for the 85 Danish questions and
70% for the 83 Italian questions. The focus is
an ontological type dependent from the topic map,
and its extraction is based on hand-crafted rules.
In our case, focus extraction – though defined with
topic map retrieval in mind – stays clear of on-
tological dependencies so that the same question
analysis module can be applied to any topic map.

In open domain QA, machine learning ap-
proaches have proved successful since Li & Roth
(Li and Roth, 2006). Despite using similar fea-
tures, the F-Score (0.824) for our EAT classes is
slightly lower than reported by Li & Roth (Li and
Roth, 2006) for coarse classes. We may speculate
that the difference is primarily due to our limited
training set size (1,680 questions versus 21,500
questions for Li & Roth). On the other hand, we
are not aware of any work attempting to extract AP
on word level using machine learning in order to
provide dynamic classes to a question classifica-
tion module.

5 Future work and conclusion

We presented a question classification system
based on our definition of focus geared towards
QA over semi-structured data where there is a
parent-child relationship between answers and
their types. The specificity of the focus degrades
gracefully in the approach described above. That
is, we attempt the extraction of the AP when possi-
ble and fall back on the EAT extraction otherwise.

We identify the focus dynamically, instead of
relying on a static taxonomy of question types,
and we do so using machine learning techniques
throughout the application stack.

A mathematical model has been devised to pre-
dict the performance of the focus extractor.

We are currently working on the exploitation of
the results provided by the focus extractor in the
subsequent modules of the QA over Topic Maps,
namely anchoring, navigation in the topic map,
graph algorithms and reasoning.
