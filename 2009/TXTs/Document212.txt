Abstract

For many NLP tasks, including named en-

tity tagging, semi-supervised learning has

been proposed as a reasonable alternative

to methods that require annotating large

amounts of training data. In this paper,

we address the problem of analyzing new

data given a semi-supervised NE tagger

trained on data from an earlier time pe-

riod. We will show that updating the unla-

beled data is sufficient to maintain quality

over time, and outperforms updating the

labeled data. Furthermore, we will also

show that augmenting the unlabeled data

with older data in most cases does not re-

sult in better performance than simply us-

ing a smaller amount of current unlabeled

data.

1 Introduction

Brill (2003) observed large gains in performance

for different NLP tasks solely by increasing the

size of unlabeled data, but stressed that for other

NLP tasks, such as named entity recognition

(NER), we still need to focus on developing tools

that help to increase the size of annotated data.

This problem is particularly crucial when pro-

cessing languages, such as Portuguese, for which

the labeled data is scarce. For instance, in the first

NER evaluation for Portuguese, HAREM (San-

tos and Cardoso, 2007), only two out of the nine

participants presented systems based on machine

learning, and they both argued they could have

achieved significantly better results if they had

larger training sets.

Semi-supervised methods are commonly cho-

sen as an alternative to overcome the lack of an-

notated resources, because they present a good

trade-off between amount of labeled data needed

and performance achieved. Co-training is one of

those methods, and has been extensively studied in

NLP (Nigam and Ghani, 2000; Pierce and Cardie,

2001; Ng and Cardie, 2003; Mota and Grishman,

2008). In particular, we showed that the perfor-

mance of a name tagger based on co-training de-

cays as the time gap between training data (seeds

and unlabeled data) and test data increases (Mota

and Grishman, 2008). Compared to the original

classifier of Collins and Singer (1999) that uses

seven seeds, we used substantially larger seed sets

(more than 1000), which raises the question of

which of the parameters (seeds or unlabeled data)

are causing the performance deterioration.

In the present study, we investigated two main

questions, from the point of view of a developer

who wants to analyze a new data set, given an NE

tagger trained with older data. First, we studied

whether it was better to update the seeds or the

unlabeled data; then, we analyzed whether using

a smaller amount of current unlabeled data could

be better than increasing the amount of unlabeled

data drawn from older sources. The experiments

show that using contemporary unlabeled data is

the best choice, outperforming most experiments

with larger amounts of older unlabeled data and

all experiments with contemporary seeds.

2 Contemporary labeled data in NLP

The speech community has been defending for

some time now the idea of having similar tem-

poral data for training and testing automatic

speech recognition systems for broadcast news.

Most works focus on improving out-of-vocabulary

(OOV) rates, to which new names contribute

significantly. For instance, Palmer and Osten-

dorf (2005) aiming at reducing the error rate due

to OOV names propose to generate offline name

lists from diverse sources, including temporally

relevant news texts; Federico and Bertoldi (2004),

and Martins et al. (2006) propose to daily adapt

the statistical language model of a broadcast

353



news transcription system, exploiting contempo-

rary newswire texts available on the web; Auzanne

et al. (2000) proposed a time-adaptive language

model, studying its impact over a period of five

months on the reduction of OOV rate, word error

rate and retrieval accuracy on a spoken document

retrieval system.

Concerning variations over longer periods of

time, we observed that the performance of a semi-

supervised name tagger decays over a period of

eight years, which seems to be directly related

with the fact that the texts used to train and test the

tagger also show a tendency to become less simi-

lar over time (Mota and Grishman, 2008); Batista

et al. (2008) also observed a decaying tendency in

the performance of a system for recovering capi-

talization over a period of six years, proposing to

retrain a MaxEnt model using additional contem-

porary written texts.

3 Name tagger overview

We assessed the name tagger described in Mota

and Grishman (2008) to recognize names of peo-

ple, organizations and locations. The tagger is

based on the co-training NE classifier proposed

by Collins and Singer (1999), and is comprised

of several components organized sequentially (cf.

Figure 1).

4 Data sets

CETEMPúblico (Rocha and Santos, 2000) is a

Portuguese journalistic corpus with 180 million

words that spans eight years of news, from 1991

to 1998. The minimum size of epoch (time span

of data set) available for analysis is a six-month

period, corresponding either to the first half of the

year or the second.

The data sets were created using the first 8256

extracts1 within each six-month period of the pol-

itics section of the corpus: the first 192 are used to

collect seeds, the next 208 extracts are used as test

sets and the remaining 7856 are used to collect the

unlabeled examples. The seeds correspond to the

first 1150 names occurring in those extracts. From

the list of unlabeled examples obtained after the

NE identification stage, only the first 41226 exam-

ples of each epoch were used to bootstrap in the

classification stage.

5 Experiments

We denote by S, U and T , respectively, the seed,
unlabeled and test texts, and by (Si, Uj , Tk) a
training-test configuration, where 91a ≤ i, j, k ≤
98b, i.e., epochs i, j and k vary between the first
half of 1991 (91a) and the second half of 1998

(98b). For instance, the training-test configuration

(Si=91a...98b, Ui=91a...98b, Tj=98b) represents the
training-test configuration where the test set was

drawn from epoch 98b, and the tagger was trained

in turn with seeds and unlabeled data drawn from

the same epoch i that varied from 91a to 98b.

5.1 Do we need contemporary labeled data?

In order to understand whether it is better to label

examples falling within the epoch of the test set

or to keep using old labeled data while bootstrap-

ping with contemporary unlabeled data, we fixed

the test set to be within the last epoch of the inter-

val (98b), and performed backward experiments,

i.e., we varied the epoch of either the seeds or the

unlabeled data backwards. The choice of fixing

the test within the last epoch of the interval is the

one that most approximates a real situation where

one has a tagger trained with old data and wants to

process a more recent text.

Figure 2 shows the results for both experiments,

where (Sj=98b, Ui=91a...98b, Tj=98b) represents the
experiment where the test was within the same

epoch as the seeds and the unlabeled data were

drawn from a single, variable, epoch in turn, and

(Si=91a...98b, Uj=98b, Tj=98b) represents the exper-
iment where the test was within the epoch of the

unlabeled data and the seeds were drawn in turn

from each of the epochs; the graphic also shows

Figure 2: F-measure over time for test set 98b with
configurations: (Si=91a...98b, Ui=91a...98b, Tj=98b),
(Sj=98b, Ui=91a...98b, Tj=98b), and (Si=91a...98b,
Uj=98b, Tj=98b)

As can be seen, there is a small gain in perfor-

mance by using seeds within the epoch of the test

set, but the decay is still observable as we increase

the time gap between the unlabeled data and the

test set. On the contrary, if we use unlabeled data

within the epoch of the test set, we hardly see

a degradation trend as the time gap between the

epochs of seeds and test set is increased.

An examination of the results shows that, for

instance, Sendero Luminoso received the correct

classification of organization when the tagger is

trained with unlabeled data drawn from the same

epoch, but is incorretly classified as person when

trained with data that is not contemporary with the

test set. Even though that name is not a seed in any

of the cases, it occurs twice in good contexts for

organization in unlabeled data contemporary with

the test set (lı́der do Sendero Luminoso/leader of

the Shining Path and acções do Sendero Lumi-

noso/actions of the Shining Path), while it does

not occur in the unlabeled data that is not contem-

porary. Given that both the name spelling and the

context in the test set, o messianismo do peruano

Sendero Luminoso/the messianism of the Peruvian

Shining Path, are insufficient to assign a correct la-

bel, the occurrence of the name in the contempo-

rary unlabeled data contributes to its correct clas-

sification in the test set.

5.2 Is more older unlabeled data better?

The second question we addressed was whether

having more older unlabeled data could result in

better performance than less data but within the

epoch of the test set. In this case, we conducted

two backward experiments, augmenting the un-

labeled data backwards with older data than the

test set (98b), starting in the previous epoch (98a):

in the first experiment, the seeds were within the

same epoch as the test set, and in the second ex-

periment the seeds were within the same epoch as

the unlabeled set being added. This corresponds to

configurations (Sj=98b, U
′
i=91a...98a, Tj=98b) and

(Si=91a...98a, U
′
i=91a...98a, Tj=98b), respectively,

where U
′
i =

⋃98a
k=i Uk.

In Figure 3, we show the result of these con-

figurations together with the result of the back-

ward experiment corresponding to configuration

(Si=91a...98b, Uj=98b, Tj=98b), also represented in
Figure 2. We note that, in the case of the former

experiments, the size of the unlabeled examples is

increasing in the direction 98a to 91a.

As can be observed, increasing the size of the

unlabeled data does not necessarily result in bet-

ter performance: for both choices of seeds, perfor-

mance sometimes improves, sometimes worsens,

as the unlabeled data grows (following the curves

355



from right to left).

Furthermore, the tagger trained with more unla-

beled data in most cases did not outperform the

tagger trained with less unlabeled data selected

from the epoch of the test set.

6 Discussion and future directions

We conducted experiments varying the epoch of

seeds and unlabeled data of a named entity tagger

based on co-training. We observed that the per-

formance decay resulting from increasing the time

gap between training data (seeds and unlabeled ex-

amples) and the test set can be slightly attenuated

by using the seeds contemporary with the test set.

The gain is larger if one uses older seeds and con-

temporary unlabeled data, a strategy that, in most

of the experiments, results in better performance

than using increasing sizes of older unlabeled data.

These results suggest that we may not need to

label new data nor train our tagger with increasing

sizes of data, as long as we are able to train it with

unlabeled data time compatible with the test set.

In the future, one issue that needs clarification is

why bootstraping from contemporary labeled data

had so little influence on the performance of co-

training, and if other semi-supervised approches

are also sensitive to this question.
