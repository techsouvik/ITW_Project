Abstract

The use of figurative language is ubiqui-
tous in natural language texts and it is a
serious bottleneck in automatic text un-
derstanding. We address the problem of
interpretation of logical metonymy, using
a statistical method. Our approach origi-
nates from that of Lapata and Lascarides
(2003), which generates a list of non-
disambiguated interpretations with their
likelihood derived from a corpus. We pro-
pose a novel sense-based representation
of the interpretation of logical metonymy
and a more thorough evaluation method
than that of Lapata and Lascarides (2003).
By carrying out a human experiment we
prove that such a representation is intu-
itive to human subjects. We derive a rank-
ing scheme for verb senses using an unan-
notated corpus, WordNet sense numbering
and glosses. We also provide an account
of the requirements that different aspec-
tual verbs impose onto the interpretation
of logical metonymy. We tested our sys-
tem on verb-object metonymic phrases. It
identifies and ranks metonymic interpreta-
tions with the mean average precision of
0.83 as compared to the gold standard.

1 Introduction

Metonymy is defined as the use of a word or a
phrase to stand for a related concept which is not
explicitly mentioned. Here are some examples of
metonymic phrases:

(1) The pen is mightier than the sword.

(2) He played Bach.

(3) He drank his glass. (Fass, 1991)

(4) He enjoyed the book. (Lapata and Lascarides,
2003)

(5) After three martinis John was feeling well.
(Godard and Jayez, 1993)

The metonymic adage in (1) is a classical ex-
ample. Here the pen stands for the press and the
sword for military power. In the following exam-
ple Bach is used to refer to the composer’s music
and in (3) the glass stands for its content, i.e. the
actual drink (beverage).

The sentences (4) and (5) represent a varia-
tion of this phenomenon called logical metonymy.
Here both the book and three martinis have even-
tive interpretations, i.e. the noun phrases stand
for the events of reading the book and drinking
three martinis respectively. Such behaviour is
triggered by the type requirements the verb (or
the preposition) places onto its argument. This
is known in linguistics as a phenomenon of type
coercion. Many existing approaches to logical
metonymy explain systematic syntactic ambiguity
of metonymic verbs (such as enjoy) or preposi-
tions (such as after) by means of type coercion
(Pustejovsky, 1991; Pustejovsky, 1995; Briscoe
et al., 1990; Verspoor, 1997; Godard and Jayez,
1993).

Logical metonymy occurs in natural language
texts relatively frequently. Therefore, its auto-
matic interpretation would significantly facilitate
the task of many NLP applications that require
semantic processing (e.g., machine translation,
information extraction, question answering and
many others). Utiyama et al. (2000) followed by
Lapata and Lascarides (2003) used text corpora to
automatically derive interpretations of metonymic
phrases.

1



Utiyama et al. (2000) used a statistical model
for the interpretation of general metonymies for
Japanese. Given a verb-object metonymic phrase,
such as read Shakespeare, they searched for en-
tities the object could stand for, such as plays of
Shakespeare. They considered all the nouns co-
occurring with the object noun and the Japanese
equivalent of the preposition of. Utiyama and his
colleagues tested their approach on 75 metonymic
phrases taken from the literature and reported a
precision of 70.6%, whereby an interpretation was
considered correct if it made sense in some imag-
inary context.

Lapata and Lascarides (2003) extend Utiyama’s
approach to interpretation of logical metonymies
containing aspectual verbs (e.g. begin the book)
and polysemous adjectives (e.g. good meal vs.
good cook). Their method generates a list of in-
terpretations with their likelihood derived from a
corpus.

Lapata and Lascarides define an interpretation
of logical metonymy as a verb string, which is am-
biguous with respect to word sense. Some of these
strings indeed correspond to paraphrases that a hu-
man would give for the metonymic phrase. But
they are not meaningful as such for automatic pro-
cessing, since their senses still need to be disam-
biguated in order to obtain the actual meaning. For
example, compare the grab sense of take vs. its
film sense for the metonymic phrase finish video.
It is obvious that only the latter sense is a correct
interpretation.

We extend the experiment of Lapata and Las-
carides by disambiguating the interpretations with
respect to WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) synsets (for
verb-object metonymic phrases). We propose a
novel ranking scheme for the synsets using a
non-disambiguated corpus, address the issue of
sense frequency distribution and utilize informa-
tion from WordNet glosses to refine the ranking.

We conduct and experiment to show that our
representation of a metonymic interpretation as a
synset is intuitive to human subjects. In the dis-
cussion section we provide an overview of the
constraints on logical metonymy pointed out in
linguistics literature, as well as proposing some
additional constraints (e.g. on the type of the
metonymic verb, on the type of the reconstructed
event, etc.)

(2003) for finish video

2 Lapata and Lascarides’ Method

The intuition behind the approach of Lapata and
Lascarides is similar to that of Pustejovsky (1991;
1995), namely that there is an event not explic-
itly mentioned, but implied by the metonymic
phrase (begin to read the book, or the meal that
tastes good vs. the cook that cooks well). They
used the British National Corpus (BNC)(Burnard,
2007) parsed by the Cass parser (Abney, 1996) to
extract events (verbs) co-occurring with both the
metonymic verb (or adjective) and the noun inde-
pendently and ranked them in terms of their like-
lihood according to the data. The likelihood of a
particular interpretation is calculated using the fol-
lowing formula:

P (e, v, o) =
f(v, e) · f(o, e)

N · f(e) , (1)

where e stands for the eventive interpretation of
the metonymic phrase, v for the metonymic verb
and o for its noun complement. f(e), f(v, e)
and f(o, e) are the respective corpus frequencies.
N =

∑
i f(ei) is the total number of verbs in the

corpus. The list of interpretations Lapata and Las-
carides (2003) report for the phrase finish video is
shown in Table 1.

Lapata and Lascarides compiled their test set by
selecting 12 verbs that allow logical metonymy1

from the lexical semantics literature and combin-
ing each of them with 5 nouns. This yields 60
phrases, which were then manually filtered, ex-
cluding 2 phrases as non-metonymic.

They compared their results to paraphrase
judgements elicited from humans. The subjects
were presented with three interpretations for each

sist, start, survive, try, want

metonymic phrase (from high, medium and low
probability ranges) and were asked to associate a
number with each of them reflecting how good
they found the interpretation. They report a cor-
relation of 0.64, whereby the inter-subject agree-
ment was 0.74. It should be noted, however, that
such an evaluation scheme is not very informa-
tive as Lapata and Lascarides calculate correlation
only on 3 data points for each phrase out of many
more yielded by the model. It fails to take into
account the quality of the list of top interpreta-
tions, although the latter is deemed to be the aim of
such applications. In comparison the fact that La-
pata and Lascarides initially select the interpreta-
tions from high, medium or low probability ranges
makes the task significantly easier.

3 Alternative Interpretation of Logical
Metonymy

The approach of Lapata and Lascarides (2003)
produces a list of non-disambiguated verbs, essen-
tially just strings, representing possible interpreta-
tions of a metonymic phrase. We propose an alter-
native representation of metonymy interpretation
consisting of a list of senses that map to WordNet
synsets. However, the sense-based representation
builds on the list of non-disambiguated interpreta-
tions similar to the one of Lapata and Lascarides.

Our method consists of the following steps:

• Step 1 Use the method of Lapata and Las-
carides (2003) to obtain a set of candidate in-
terpretations (strings) from a non-annotated
corpus. We expect our reimplementation of
the method to extract data more accurately,
since we use a more robust parser (RASP
(Briscoe et al., 2006)), take into account more
syntactic structures (coordination, passive),
and extract our data from a newer version of
the BNC.

• Step 2 Map strings to WordNet synsets. We
noticed that good interpretations in the lists
yielded by Step 1 tend to form coherent se-
mantic classes (e.g. take, shoot [a video] vs.
view, watch [a video]). We search the list
for verbs, whose senses are in hyponymy and
synonymy relations with each other accord-
ing to WordNet and store these senses.

• Step 3 Rank the senses, adopting Zipfian
sense frequency distribution and using the

initial string likelihood as well as the infor-
mation from WordNet glosses.

Sense disambiguation is essentially performed
in both Step 2 and Step 3. One of the challenges
of our task is that we use a non-disambiguated cor-
pus while ranking particular senses. This is due to
the fact that there is no word sense disambiguated
corpus available, which would be large enough to
reliably extract statistics for metonymic interpre-
tations.

4 Extracting Ambiguous Interpretations

4.1 Parameter Estimation

We used the method developed by Lapata and
Lascarides (2003) to create the initial list of non-
disambiguated interpretations. The parameters of
the model were estimated from the British Na-
tional Corpus (BNC) (Burnard, 2007) that was
parsed using the RASP parser of Briscoe et al.
(2006). We used the grammatical relations (GRs)
output of RASP for BNC created by Andersen et
al. (2008). In particular, we extracted all direct
and indirect object relations for the nouns from
the metonymic phrases, i.e. all the verbs that take
the head noun in the compliment as an object (di-
rect or indirect), in order to obtain the counts for
f(o, e). Relations expressed in the passive voice
and with the use of coordination were also ex-
tracted. The verb-object pairs attested in the cor-
pus only once were discarded, as well as the verb
be, since it does not add any semantic informa-
tion to the metonymic interpretation. In the case
of indirect object relations, the verb was consid-
ered to constitute an interpretation together with
the preposition, e.g. for the metonymic phrase en-
joy the city the correct interpretation is live in as
opposed to live.

As the next step we need to identify all possible
verb phrase (VP) complements to the metonymic
verb (both progressive and infinitive), which rep-
resent f(v, e). This was done by searching for
xcomp relations in the GRs output of RASP, in
which our metonymic verb participates in any of
its inflected forms. Infinitival and progressive
complement counts were summed up to obtain the
final frequency f(v, e).

After the frequencies f(v, e) and f(o, e) were
obtained, possible interpretations were ranked ac-
cording to the model of Lapata and Lascarides
(2003). The top interpretations for the metonymic

4.2 Comparison with the Results of Lapata
and Lascarides

We compared the output of our reimplementation
of Lapata and Lascarides’ algorithm with their re-
sults, which we obtained from the authors. The
major difference between the two systems is that
we extracted our data from the BNC parsed by
RASP, as opposed to the Cass chunk parser (Ab-
ney, 1996) utilized by Lapata and Lascarides. Our
system finds approximately twice as many in-
terpretations as theirs and covers 80% of their
lists (our system does not find some of the low-
probability range verbs of Lapata and Lascarides).
We compared the rankings of the two implemen-
tations in terms of Pearson correlation coefficient
and obtained the average correlation of 0.83 (over
all metonymic phrases).

We also evaluated the performance of our sys-
tem against the judgements elicited from humans
in the framework of the experiment of Lapata and
Lascarides (2003) (for a detailed description of
the human evaluation setup see (Lapata and Las-
carides, 2003), pages 12-18). The Pearson corre-
lation coefficient between the ranking of our sys-
tem and the human ranking equals to 0.62 (the in-
tersubject agreement on this task is 0.74). This
is slightly lower than the number achieved by La-
pata and Lascarides (0.64). Such a difference is
probably due to the fact that our system does not
find some of the low-probability range verbs that
Lapata and Lascarides included in their test set,
and thus those interpretations get assigned a prob-
ability of 0. We conducted a one-tailed t-test to

determine if our counts were significantly differ-
ent from those of Lapata and Lascarides. The dif-
ference is statistically insignificant (t=3.6; df=180;
p<.0005), and the output of the system is deemed
acceptable to be used for further experiments.

5 Mapping Interpretations to WordNet
Senses

The interpretations at this stage are just strings
representing collectively all senses of the verb.
What we aim for is the list of verb senses that are
correct interpretations for the metonymic phrase.
We assume the WordNet synset representation of
a sense.

It has been recognized (Pustejovsky, 1991;
Pustejovsky, 1995; Godard and Jayez, 1993) and
verified by us empirically that correct interpreta-
tions tend to form semantic classes, and therefore,
correct interpretations should be related to each
other by semantic relations, such as synonymy or
hyponymy. In order to select the right senses of
the verbs in the context of the metonymic phrase
we did the following.

• We searched the WordNet database for the
senses of the verbs that are in synonymy, hy-
pernymy and hyponymy relations.

• We stored the corresponding synsets in a new
list of interpretations. If one synset was a hy-
pernym (or hyponym) of the other, then both
synsets were stored.

For example, for the metonymic phrase finish
video the interpretations watch, view and see
are synonymous, therefore a synset contain-
ing (watch(3) view(3) see(7)) was
stored. This means that sense 3 of watch, sense
3 of view and sense 7 of see would be correct
interpretations of the metonymic expression.

The obtained number of synsets ranges from 14
(try shampoo) to 1216 (want money) for the whole
dataset of Lapata and Lascarides (2003).

6 Ranking the Senses

A problem that arises with the lists of synsets ob-
tained is that they contain different senses of the
same verb. However, very few verbs have such a
range of meanings that their two different senses
could represent two distinct metonymic interpre-
tations (e.g., in case of take interpretation of finish
video shoot sense and look at, consider sense are

4



both acceptable interpretations, the second obvi-
ously being dispreferred). In the vast majority of
cases the occurrence of the same verb in different
synsets means that the list still needs filtering.

In order to do this we rank the synsets accord-
ing to their likelihood of being a metonymic inter-
pretation. The sense ranking is largely based on
the probabilities of the verb strings derived by the
model of Lapata and Lascarides (2003).

6.1 Zipfian Sense Frequency Distribution

The probability of each string from our initial list
represents the sum of probabilities of all senses of
this verb. Hence this probability mass needs to be
distributed over senses first. The sense frequency
distribution for most words tends to be closer to
Zipfian, rather than uniform or any other distribu-
tion (Preiss, 2006). This is an approximation that
we rely on, as it has been shown to realistically
describe the majority of words.

This means that the first senses will be favoured
over the others, and the frequency of each sense
will be inversely proportional to its rank in the list
of senses (i.e. sense number, since word senses are
ordered in WordNet by frequency).

Pv,k = Pv ·
1
k

(2)

where k is the sense number and Pv is the likeli-
hood of the verb string being an interpretation ac-
cording to the corpus data, i.e.

Pv =
Nv∑
k=1

Pv,k (3)

where Nv is the total number of senses for the verb
in question.

The problem that arises with (2) is that the in-
verse sense numbers (1/k) do not add up to 1. In
order to circumvent this, the Zipfian distribution
is commonly normalised by the Nth generalised
harmonic number. Assuming the same notation

Pv,k = Pv ·
1/k∑Nv

n=1 1/n
(4)

Once we have obtained the sense probabilities
Pv,k, we can calculate the likelihood of the whole
synset

Ps =
Is∑

i=1

Pvi,k (5)

where vi is a verb in the synset s and Is is the
total number of verbs in the synset s. The verbs
suggested by WordNet, but not attested in the
corpus in the required environment, are assigned
the probability of 0. Some output synsets for
the metonymic phrase finish video and their log-
probabilities are demonstrated in Table 3.

In our experiment we compare the performance
of the system assuming a Zipfian distribution of
senses against the baseline using a uniform distri-
bution. We expect the former to yield better re-
sults.

6.2 Gloss Processing

The model in the previous section penalizes
synsets that are incorrect interpretations. How-
ever, it can not discriminate well between the ones
consisting of a single verb. By default it favours
the sense with a smaller sense number in Word-
Net. This poses a problem for the examples such
as direct for the phrase finish video: our list con-
tains several senses of it, as shown in Table 4, and
their ranking is not satisfactory. The only correct
interpretation in this case, sense 3, is assigned a
lower likelihood than the senses 1 and 2.

The most relevant synset can be found by us-
ing the information from WordNet glosses (the
verbal descriptions of concepts, often with ex-
amples). We searched for the glosses contain-
ing terms related to the noun in the metonymic
phrase, here video. Such related terms would
be its direct synonyms, hyponyms, hypernyms,
meronyms or holonyms according to WordNet.
We assigned more weight to the synsets whose
gloss contained related terms. In our example
the synset (direct-v-3), which is the correct
metonymic interpretation, contained the term film
in its gloss and was therefore selected. Its likeli-
hood was multiplied by the factor of 10.

It should be noted, however, that the glosses do
not always contain the related terms; the expecta-
tion is that they will be useful in the majority of
cases, not in all of them.

7.1 The Gold Standard

We selected the most frequent metonymic verbs
for our experiments: begin, enjoy, finish, try, start.
We randomly selected 10 metonymic phrases con-
taining these verbs. We split them into the devel-
opment set (5 phrases) and the test set (5 phrases)

given in the table 5.
The gold standards were created for the top 30

synsets of each metonymic phrase after ranking.
This threshold was set experimentally: the recall
of correct interpretations among the top 30 synsets
is 0.75 (average over metonymic phrases from the
development set). This threshold allows to filter
out a large number of incorrect interpretations.

The interpretations that are plausible in some
imaginary context are marked as correct in the
gold standard.

7.2 Evaluation Measure

We evaluated the performance of the system
against the gold standard. The objective was to
find out if the synsets were distributed in such a
way that the plausible interpretations appear at the
top of the list and the incorrect ones at the bottom.
The evaluation was done in terms of mean average
precision (MAP) at top 30 synsets.

MAP =

Pji, (6)

where M is the number of metonymic phrases,
Nj is the number of correct interpretations for the
metonymic phrase, Pji is the precision at each cor-
rect interpretation (the number of correct interpre-
tations among the top i ranks). First, the aver-
age precision was computed for each metonymic
phrase independently. Then the mean values were
calculated for the development and the test sets.

The reasoning behind computing MAP instead
of precision at a fixed number of synsets (e.g.
top 30) is that the number of correct interpreta-
tions varies dramatically for different metonymic
phrases. MAP essentially evaluates how many
good interpretations appear at the top of the list,
which takes this variation into account.

7.3 Results

We compared the ranking obtained by applying
Zipfian sense frequency distribution against that
obtained by distributing probability mass over
senses uniformly (baseline). We also considered
the rankings before and after gloss processing.
The results are shown in Table 6. These results
demonstrate the positive contribution of both Zip-
fian distribution and gloss processing to the rank-
ing.

7.4 Human Experiment

We conducted an experiment with humans in order
to prove that this task is intuitive to people, i.e.
they agree on the task.

them were native speakers of English and non-

Subjects in each group annotated three metonymic
phrases as shown in Table 7. They received writ-
ten guidelines, which were the only source of in-
formation on the experiment.

For each metonymic phrase they were presented
with a list of 30 possible interpretations produced
by the system. For each synset in the list they had
to decide whether it was a plausible interpretation
of the metonymic phrase in an imaginary context.

We evaluated interannotator agreement in terms
of Fleiss’ kappa (Fleiss, 1971) and f-measure com-
puted pairwise and then averaged across the an-
notators. The agreement in group 1 was 0.76
(f-measure) and 0.56 (kappa); in group 2 0.68
(f-measure) and 0.51 (kappa). This yielded the
average agreement of 0.72 (f-measure) and 0.53
(kappa).

8 Linguistic Perspective on Logical
Metonymy

There has been debate in linguistics literature as
whether it is the noun or the verb in the metonymic
phrase that determines the interpretation. Some of
the accounts along with our own analysis are pre-
sented below.

8.1 The Effect of the Noun Complement

The interpretation of logical metonymy is often
explained by the lexical defaults associated with
the noun complement in the metonymic phrase.
Pustejovsky (1991) models these lexical defaults
in the form of the qualia structure of the noun. The
qualia structure of a noun specifies the following
aspects of its meaning:

• CONSTITUTIVE Role (the relation between
an object and its constituents)

• FORMAL Role (that which distinguishes the
object within a larger domain)

• TELIC Role (purpose and function of the ob-
ject)

• AGENTIVE Role (how the object came into
being)

For the problem of logical metonymy the telic and
agentive roles are of particular interest. For ex-
ample, the noun book would have read specified
as its telic role and write as its agentive role in
its qualia structure. Following Pustejovsky (1991;
1995) and others, we take this information from
the noun qualia to represent the default interpre-
tations of metonymic constructions. Nevertheless,
multiple telic and agentive roles can exist and be
valid interpretations, which is supported by the ev-
idence derived from the corpus (Verspoor, 1997).

Such lexical defaults operate with a lack of
pragmatic information. In some cases, however,
lexical defaults can be overridden by context.
Consider the following example taken from Las-
carides and Copestake (1995).

(6) My goat eats anything. He really enjoyed
your book.

Here it is clear that the goat enjoyed eating the
book and not reading the book, which is enforced
by the context. Thus, incorporating the context of
the metonymic phrase into the model would be an-
other interesting extension of our experiment.

8.2 The Effect of the Metonymic Verb
By analysing phrases from the dataset of Lap-
ata and Lascarides (2003) we found that different
metonymic verbs have different effect on the inter-
pretation of logical metonymy. In this section we
provide some criteria based on which one could
classify metonymic verbs:

• Control vs. raising. Consider the phrase ex-
pect poetry taken from the dataset of Lap-
ata and Lascarides. Expect is a typical ob-
ject raising verb and, therefore, the most ob-
vious interpretation of this phrase would be
expect someone to learn/recite poetry, rather
than expect to hear poetry or expect to learn
poetry, as suggested by the model of Lapata

and Lascarides. Their model does not take
into account raising syntactic frame and as
such its interpretation of raising metonymic
phrases will be based on the wrong kind
of corpus evidence. Our expectation, how-
ever, is that control verbs tend to form logical
metonymies more frequently. By analyzing
the lists of control and raising verbs compiled
by Boguraev and Briscoe (1987) we found
evidence supporting this claim. Only 20% of
raising verbs can form metonymic construc-
tions (e.g. expect, allow, command, request,
require etc.), while others can not (e.g. ap-
pear, seem, consider etc.). Due to both this
and the fact that we build on the approach of
Lapata and Lascarides (2003), we gave pref-
erence to control verbs to develop and test our
system.

• Activity vs. result. Some metonymic verbs
require the reconstructed event to be an ac-
tivity (e.g. begin writing the book), while oth-
ers require a result (e.g. attempt to reach the
peak). This distinction potentially allows to
rule out some incorrect interpretations, e.g. a
resultative find for enjoy book, as enjoy re-
quires an event of the type activity. Automat-
ing this would be an interesting route for ex-
tension of our experiment.

• Telic vs. agentive vs. other events. An-
other interesting observation we made cap-
tures the constraints that the metonymic verb
imposes on the reconstructed event in terms
of its function. While some metonymic verbs
require rather telic events (e.g., enjoy, want,
try), others have strong preference for agen-
tive (e.g., start). However, for some cate-
gories of verbs it is hard to define a partic-
ular type of the event they require (e.g., at-
tempt the peak should be interpreted as at-
tempt to reach the peak, which is neither telic
nor agentive).

9 Conclusions and Future Work

We presented a system producing disambiguated
interpretations of logical metonymy with respect
to word sense. Such representation is novel and
it is intuitive to humans, as demonstrated by the
human experiment. We also proposed a novel
scheme for estimating the likelihood of a WordNet
synset as a unit from a non-disambiguated corpus.

The obtained results demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach to deriving metonymic interpreta-
tions.

Along with this we provided criteria for dis-
criminating between different metonymic verbs
with respect to their effect on the interpretation
of logical metonymy. Our empirical analysis has
shown that control verbs tend to form logical
metonymy more frequently than raising verbs, as
well as that the former comply with the model of
Lapata and Lascarides (2003), whereas the latter
form logical metonymies based on a different syn-
tactic frame. Incorporating such linguistic knowl-
edge into the model would be an interesting exten-
sion of this experiment.

One of the motivations of the proposed sense-
based representation is the fact that the interpreta-
tions of metonymic phrases tend to form coher-
ent semantic classes (Pustejovsky, 1991; Puste-
jovsky, 1995; Godard and Jayez, 1993). The au-
tomatic discovery of such classes would require
word sense disambiguation as an initial step. This
is due to the fact that it is verb senses that form the
classes rather than verb strings. Comparing the in-
terpretations obtained for the phrase finish video,
one can clearly distinguish between the meaning
pertaining to the creation of the video, e.g., film,
shoot, take, and those denoting using the video,
e.g., watch, view, see. Discovering such classes
using the existing verb clustering techniques is our
next experiment.

Using sense-based interpretations of logical
metonymy as opposed to ambiguous verbs could
benefit other NLP applications that rely on disam-
biguated text (e.g. for the tasks of information re-
trieval (Voorhees, 1998) and question answering
(Pasca and Harabagiu, 2001)).
