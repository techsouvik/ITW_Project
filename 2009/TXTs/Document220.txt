Abstract
This paper presents ongoing research in
clinical information extraction. This work
introduces a new genre of text which are
not well-written, noise prone, ungrammat-
ical and with much cryptic content. A cor-
pus of clinical progress notes drawn form
an Intensive Care Service has been manu-
ally annotated with more than 15000 clin-
ical named entities in 11 entity types. This
paper reports on the challenges involved in
creating the annotation schema, and recog-
nising and annotating clinical named enti-
ties. The information extraction task has
initially used two approaches: a rule based
system and a machine learning system
using Conditional Random Fields (CRF).
Different features are investigated to as-
sess the interaction of feature sets and the
supervised learning approaches to estab-
lish the combination best suited to this
data set. The rule based and CRF sys-
tems achieved an F-score of 64.12% and
81.48% respectively.

1 Introduction

A substantial amount of clinical data is locked
away in a non-standardised form of clinical lan-
guage, which if standardised could be usefully
mined to improve processes in the work of clin-
ical wards, and to gain greater understanding of
patient care as well as the progression of diseases.
However in some clinical contexts these clinical
notes, as written by a clinicians, are in a less struc-
tured and often minimal grammatical form with
idiosyncratic and cryptic shorthand. Whilst there
is increasing interest in the automatic extraction
of the contents of clinical text, this particular type
of notes cause significant difficulties for automatic
extraction processes not present for well-written
prose notes.

The first step to the extraction of structured in-
formation from these clinical notes is to achieve
accurate identification of clinical concepts or
named entities. An entity may refer to a concrete
object mentioned in the notes. For example, there
are 3 named entities - CT, pituitary macroade-
noma and suprasellar cisterns in the sentence:
CT revealed pituitary macroadenoma in suprasel-
lar cisterns.

In recent years, the recognition of named en-
tities from biomedical scientific literature has be-
come the focus of much research, a large number
of systems have been built to recognise, classify
and map biomedical terms to ontologies. How-
ever, clinical terms such as findings, procedures
and drugs have received less attention. Although
different approaches have been proposed to iden-
tify clinical concepts and map them to terminolo-
gies (Aronson, 2001; Hazlehurst et al., 2005;
Friedman et al., 2004; Jimeno et al., 2008), most
of the approaches are language pattern based,
which suffer from low recall. The low recall rate
is mainly due to the incompleteness of medical
lexicon and expressive use of alternative lexico-
grammatical structures by the writers. However,
only little work has used machine learning ap-
proaches, because no training data has been avail-
able, or the data are not available for clinical
named entity identification.

There are semantically annotated corpora that
have been developed in biomedical domain in the
past few years, for example, the GENIA cor-
pus of 2000 Medline abstracts has been annotated
with biological entities (Kim et al., 2003); The
PennBioIE corpus of 2300 Medline abstracts an-
notated with biomedical entities, part-of-speech
tag and some Penn Treebank style syntactic struc-
tures (Mandel, 2006) and LLL05 challenge task
corpus (Nédellec, 2005). However only a few cor-
pora are available in the clinical domain. Many
corpora are ad hoc annotations for evaluation, and

18



the size of the corpora are small which is not opti-
mal for machine learning strategies. The lack of
data is due to the difficulty of getting access to
clinical text for research purposes and clinical in-
formation extraction is still a new area to explore.
Many of the existing works focused only on clini-
cal conditions or disease (Ogren et al., 2006; Pes-
tian et al., 2007). The only corpus that is anno-
tated with a variety of clinical named entities is
the CLEF project (Roberts et al., 2007) .

Most of the works mentioned above are anno-
tated on formal clinical reports and scientific liter-
ature abstracts, which generally conform to gram-
matical conventions of structure and readability.
The CLEF data, annotated on clinical narrative re-
ports, still uses formal clinical reports. The clini-
cal notes presented in this work, is another genre
of text, that is different from clinical reports, be-
cause they are not well-written. Notes written
by clinicians and nurses are highly ungrammatical
and noise prone, which creates issues in the quality
of any text processing. Examples of problems aris-
ing from such texts are: firstly, variance in the rep-
resentation of core medical concepts, whether un-
consciously, such as typographical errors, or con-
sciously, such as abbreviations and personal short-
hand; secondly, the occurrences of different no-
tations to signify the same concept. The clinical
notes contain a great deal of formal terminology
but used in an informal and unorderly manner, for
example, a study of 5000 instances of Glasgow
Coma Score (GCS) readings drawn from the cor-
pus showed 321 patterns are used to denote the
same concept and over 60% of them are only used
once.

The clinical information extraction problem is
addressed in this work by applying machine learn-
ing methods to a corpus annotated for clinical
named entities. The data selection and annota-
tion process is described in Section 3. The initial
approaches to clinical concept identification using
both a rule-based approach and machine learning
approach are described in Section 4 and Section 5
respectively. A Conditional Random Fields based
system was used to study and analyse the contri-
bution of various feature types. The results and
discussion are presented in Section 6.

2 Related Work

There is a great deal of research addressing con-
cept identification and concept mapping issues.

The Unified Medical Language System Metathe-
saurus (UMLS) (Lindberg et al., 1993) is the
world’s largest medical knowledge source and it
has been the focus of much research. The sim-
plest approaches to identifying medical concepts
in text is to maintain a lexicon of all the entities
of interest and to systematically search through
that lexicon for all phrases of any length. This
can be done efficiently by using an appropriate
data structure such as a hash table. Systems that
use string matching techniques include SAPHIRE
(Hersh and Hickam, 1995), IndexFinder (Zou et
al., 2003), NIP (Huang et al., 2005) and Max-
Matcher (Zhou et al., 2006). With a large lexicon,
high precision and acceptable recall were achieved
by this approach in their experiments. However,
using these approaches out of box for our task is
not feasible, due to the high level of noise in the
clinical notes, and the ad hoc variation of the ter-
minology, will result in low precision and recall.

A more sophisticated and promising approach
is to make use of shallow parsing to identify all
noun phrases in a given text. The advantage of
this approach is that the concepts that do not exist
in the lexicon can be found. MedLEE (Friedman,
2000) is a system for information extraction in
medical discharge summaries. This system uses a
lexicon for recognising concept semantic classes,
word qualifiers, phrases, and parses the text using
its own grammar, and maps phrases to standard
medical vocabularies for clinical findings and dis-
ease. The MetaMap (Aronson, 2001) program
uses a three step process started by parsing free-
text into simple noun phrases using the Special-
ist minimal commitment parser. Then the phrase
variants are generated and mapping candidates are
generated by looking at the UMLS source vocabu-
lary. Then a scoring mechanism is used to evaluate
the fit of each term from the source vocabulary, to
reduce the potential matches (Brennan and Aron-
son, 2003). Unfortunately, the accurate identifica-
tion of noun phrases is itself a difficult problem,
especially for the clinical notes. The ICU clin-
ical notes are highly ungrammatical and contain
large number of sentence fragments and ad hoc
terminology. Furthermore, highly stylised tokens
of combinations of letters, digits and punctua-
tion forming complex morphological tokens about
clinical measurements in non-regular patterns add
an extra load on morphological analysis, e.g. “4-
6ml+/hr” means 4-6 millilitres or more secreted by

19



the patient per hour. Parsers trained on generic text
and MEDLINE abstracts have vocabularies and
language models that are inappropriate for such
ungrammatical texts.

Among the state-of-art systems for concept
identification and named entity recognition are
those that utilize machine learning or statistical
techniques. Machine learners are widely used in
biomedical named entity recognition and have out-
performed the rule based systems (Zhou et al.,
2004; Tsai et al., 2006; Yoshida and Tsujii, 2007).
These systems typically involve using many fea-
tures, such as word morphology or surrounding
context and also extensive post-processing. A
state-of-the-art biomedical named entity recog-
nizer uses lexical features, orthographic features,
semantic features and syntactic features, such as
part-of-speech and shallow parsing.

Many sequential labeling machine learners have
been used for experimentation, for example, Hid-
den Markov Model(HMM) (Rabiner, 1989), Max-
imum Entropy Markov Model (MEMM) (McCal-
lum et al., 2000) and Conditional Random Fields
(CRF) (Lafferty et al., 2001). Conditional Ran-
dom Fields have proven to be the best performing
learner for this task. The benefit of using a ma-
chine learner is that it can utilise both the infor-
mation form of the concepts themselves and the
contextual information, and it is able to perform
prediction without seeing the entire length of the
concepts. The machine learning based systems are
also good at concept disambiguation, in which a
string of text may map to multiple concepts, and
this is a difficult task for rule based approaches.

3 Annotation of Corpus

3.1 The Data

Data were selected form a 60 million token cor-
pus of Royal Prince Alfred Hospital (RPAH)’s In-
tensive Care Service (ICS). The collection con-
sists of clinical notes of over 12000 patients in
a 6 year time span. It is composed of a vari-
ety of different types of notes, for example, pa-
tient admission notes, clinician notes, physiother-
apy notes, echocardiogram reports, nursing notes,
dietitian and operating theatre reports. The corpus
for this study consists of 311 clinical notes drawn
from patients who have stayed in ICS for more
than 3 days, with most frequent causes of admis-
sion. The patients were identified in the patient
records using keywords such as cardiac disease,

Category Example
FINDING lung cancer; SOB; fever
PROCEDURE chest X Ray;laparotomy
SUBSTANCE Ceftriaxone; CO2; platelet
QUALIFIER left; right;elective; mild
BODY renal artery; LAD; diaphragm
BEHAVIOR smoker; heavy drinker
ABNORMALITY tumor; lesion; granuloma
ORGANISM HCV; proteus; B streptococcus
OBJECT epidural pump; larnygoscope
OCCUPATION cardiologist; psychiatrist
OBSERVABLE GCS; blood pressure

Table 1: Concept categories and examples.

liver disease, respiratory disease, cancer patient,
patient underwent surgery etc. Notes vary in size,
from 100 words to 500 words. Most of the notes
consist of content such as chief complaint, patient
background, current condition, history of present
illness, laboratory test reports, medications, social
history, impression and further plans. The variety
of content in the notes ensures completely differ-
ent classes of concepts are covered by the corpus.
The notes were anonymised, patient-specific iden-
tifiers such as names, phone numbers, dates were
replaced by a like value. All sensitive information
was removed before annotation.

3.2 Concept Category

Based on the advice of one doctor and one clini-
cian/terminologist, eleven concept categories were
defined in order to code the most frequently used
clinical concepts in ICS. The eleven categories
were derived from the SNOMED CT concept hier-
archy. The categories and examples are listed in
Table 1. Detailed explanation of these categories
can be found in SNOMED CT Reference Guide1

3.3 Nested Concept

Nested concepts are concepts containing other
concepts and are annotated in the corpus. They are
of particular interest due to their compositional na-
ture. For example, the term left cavernous carotid
aneurysm embolisation is the outermost concept,
which belongs to PROCEDURE. It contains sev-
eral inner concepts: the QUALIFIER left and the
term cavernous carotid aneurysm as a FINDING,

1SNOMED CT R© Technical Reference Guide - July 2008
International Release. http://www.ihtsdo.org/

20



which also contains cavernous carotid as BODY
and aneurysm as ABNORMALITY.

The recognition of nested concepts is crucial for
other tasks that depend on it, such as coreference
resolution, relation extraction, and ontology con-
struction, since nested structures implicitly con-
tain relations that may help improve their correct
recognition. The above outermost concept may be
represented by embedded concepts and relation-
ships as: left cavernous carotid aneurysm emboli-
sation IS A embolisation which has LATERALITY
left, has ASSOCIATED MORPHOLOGY aneurysm
and has PROCEDURE SITE cavernous carotid.

3.4 Concept Frequency
The frequency of annotation for each concept cat-
egory are detailed in Table 2. There are in total
15704 annotated concepts in the corpus, 12688
are outermost concepts and 3016 are inner con-
cepts. The nested concepts account for 19.21% of
all concepts in the corpus. The corpus has 46992
tokens, with 18907 tokens annotated as concepts,
hence concept density is 40.23% of the tokens.
This is higher than the density of the GENIA and
MUC corpora. The 12688 annotated outermost
concepts, results in an average length of 1.49 to-
kens per concept which is less than those of the
GENIA and MUC corpora. These statistics suggest
that ICU staff tend to use shorter terms but more
extensively in their clinical notes which is in keep-
ing with their principle of brevity.

The highest frequency concepts are FIND-
ING, SUBSTANCE, PROCEDURE, QUALIFIER and
BODY, which account 86.35% of data. The re-
maining 13.65% concepts are distributed into 6
rare categories. The inner concepts are mainly
from QUALIFIER, BODY and ABNORMALITY, be-
cause most of the long and complex FINDING
and PROCEDURE concepts contain BODY, AB-
NORMALITY and QUALIFIER, such as the example
in Section 3.3.

3.5 Annotation Agreement
The corpus had been tokenised using a white-
space tokeniser. Each note was annotated by two
annotators: the current author and a computational
linguist experienced with medical texts. Annota-
tion guidelines were developed jointly by the an-
notators and the clinicians. The guidelines were
refined and the annotators were trained using an
iterative process. At the end of each iteration, an-
notation agreement was calculated and the anno-

tations were reviewed. The guidelines were mod-
ified if necessary. This process was stopped un-
til the agreement reached a threshold. In total
30 clinical notes were used in the development
of guidelines. Inter-Annotator Agreement (IAA)
is reported as the F-score by holding one anno-
tation as the standard. F-score is commonly used
in information retrieval and information extraction
evaluations, which calculates the harmonic mean
of recall and precision as follows:

F =
2× precision× recall

precision + recall

The IAA rate in the development cycle finally
reached 89.83. The agreement rate between the
two annotators for the whole corpus by exact
matching was 88.12, including the 30 develop-
ment notes. An exact match means both the
boundaries and classes are exactly the same. The
instances where the annotators did not agree were
reviewed and relabeled by a third annotator to gen-
erate a single annotated gold standard corpus. The
third annotator is used to ensure every concept is
agreed on by at least two annotators.

Disagreements frequently occur at the bound-
aries of a term. Sometimes it is difficult to deter-
mine whether a modifier should be included in the
concept: massive medial defect or medial defect,
in which the latter one is a correct annotation and
massive is a severity modifier. Mistakes in anno-
tation also came from over annotation of a gen-
eral term: anterior approach, which should not
be annotated. Small disagreements were caused
by ambiguities in the clinical notes: some medical

21



devices (OBJECT) are often annotated as PROCE-
DURE, because the noun is used as a verb in the
context. Another source of disagreement is due to
the ambiguity in clinical knowledge: it was diffi-
cult to annotate the man-made tissues as BODY or
SUBSTANCE, such as bone graft or flap.

4 Rule Based Concept Matcher

4.1 Proofreading the Corpus

Before any other processing, the first step was
to resolve unknown tokens in the corpus. The
unknown tokens are special orthographies or al-
phabetic words that do not exist in any dic-
tionary, terminologies or gazetteers. Medical
words were extracted from the UMLS lexicon and
SNOMED CT (SNOMED International, 2009),
and the MOBY (Ward, 1996) dictionary was used
as the standard English word list. A list of abbrevi-
ations were compiled from various resources. The
abbreviations in the terminology were extracted
using pattern matching. Lists of abbreviations and
shorthand were obtained from the hospital, and
were manually compiled to resolve the meaning.
Every alphabetic token was verified against the
dictionary list, and classified into Ordinary En-
glish Words, Medical Words, Abbreviations, and
Unknown Words.

An analysis of the corpus showed 31.8% of
the total tokens are non-dictionary words, which
contains 5% unknown alphabetic words. Most
of these unknown alphabetic words are obvious
spelling mistakes. The spelling errors were cor-
rected using a spelling corrector trained on the
60 million token corpus, Abbreviations and short-
hand were expanded, for example defib expands
to defibrillator. Table 3 shows some unknown to-
kens and their resolutions. The proofreading re-
quire considerable amount of human effort to build
the dictionaries.

4.2 Lexicon look-up Token Matcher

The lexicon look-up performed exact matching be-
tween the concepts in the SNOMED CT terminol-
ogy and the concepts in the notes. A hash table
data structure was implemented to index lexical
items in the terminology. This is an extension to
the algorithm described in (Patrick et al., 2006). A
token matching matrix run through the sentence
to find all candidate matches in the sentence to
the lexicon, including exact longest matches, par-
tial matches, and overlapping between matches.

SHORTHAND h’serous haemoserous

MEASUREMENT e4v1m6 GCS measurement

SLASHWORDS abg/ck/tropt ABG CK Tropt

READINGS 7mg/hr

Table 3: Unknown tokens and their resolutions.

Then a Viterbi algorithm was used to find the best
sequence of non-overlapping concepts in a sen-
tence that maximise the total similarity score. This
method matches the term as it appears in the ter-
minology so is not robust against term variations
that have not been seen in the terminology, which
results in an extremely low recall. In addition, the
precision may be affected by ambiguous terms or
nested terms.

The exact lexicon look-up is likely to fail on
matching long and complex terms, as clinicians do
not necessarily write the modifier of a concept in
a strict order, and some descriptors are omitted.
for example white blood cell count normal can be
written as normal white cell count. In order to
increase recall, partial matching is implemented.
The partial matching tries to match the best se-
quence, but penalise non-matching gaps between
two terms. The above example will be found us-
ing partial matching.

5 CRF based Clinical Named Entity
Recogniser

5.1 Conditional Random Fields

The concept identification task has been formu-
lated as a named entity recognition task, which
can be thought of as a sequential labeling problem:
each word is a token in a sequence to be assigned
a label, for example, B-FINDING, I-FINDING, B-
PROCEDURE, I-PROCEDURE, B-SUBSTANCE, I-
SUBSTANCE and so on. Conditional Random
Fields (CRF) are undirected statistical graphical
models, which is a linear chain of Maximum En-
tropy Models that evaluate the conditional prob-
ability on a sequence of states give a sequence
of observations. Such models are suitable for se-
quence analysis. CRFs has been applied to the task

22



of recognition of biomedical named entities and
have outperformed other machine learning mod-
els. CRF++2 is used for conditional random fields
learning.

5.2 Features for the Learner

This section describes the various features used in
the CRF model. Annotated concepts were con-
verted into BIO notation, and feature vectors were
generated for each token.

Orthographic Features: Word formation was
genaralised into orthographic classes. The present
model uses 7 orthographic features to indicate
whether the words are captialised or upper case,
whether they are alphanumeric or contains any
slashes, as many findings consist of captialised
words; substances are followed by dosage, which
can be captured by the orthography. Word prefixes
and suffixes of character length 4 were also used
as features, because some procedures, substances
and findings have special affixes, which are very
distinguishable from ordinary words.

Lexical Features: Every token in the training
data was used as a feature. Alphabetic words
in the training data were converted to lowercase,
spelling errors detected in proofreading stage were
replaced by the correct resolution. Shorthand and
abbreviations were expanded into bag of words
(bow) features. The left and right lexical bi-
grams were also used as a feature, however it only
yielded a slight improvement in performance. To
utilise the context information, neighboring words
in the window [−2, +2] are also added as features.
Context window size of 2 is chosen because it
yields the best performance. The target and previ-
ous labels are also used as features, and had been
shown to be very effective.

Semantic Features: The output from the
lexical-lookup system was used as features in the
CRF model. The identified concepts were added
to the feature set as semantic features, because
the terminology can provide semantic knowledge
to the learner such as the category information of
the term. Moreover, many partially matched con-
cepts from lexicon-lookup were counted as incor-
rectly matching, however they are single term head
nouns which are effective features in NER.

Syntactic features were not used in this exper-
iment as the texts have only a little grammatical
structure. Most of the texts appeared in fragmen-

tary sentences or single word or phrase bullet point
format, which is difficult for generic parsers to
work with correctly.

6 Evaluation

This section presents experiment results for both
the rule-based system and machine learning based
system. Only the 12688 outermost concepts are
used in the experiments, because nested terms re-
sult in multi-label for a single token. Since there
is no outermost concepts in ABNORMALITY, the
classification was done on the remaining 10 cate-
gories. The performances were evaluated in terms
of recall, precision and F-score.

6.1 Token Matcher Performance
The lexical lookup performance is evaluated on
the whole corpus. The first system uses only ex-
act matching without any pre-processing of the
lexicon. The second experiment uses a pruned
terminology with ambiguous categories and un-
necessary categories removed, but without proof-
reading of the corpus. The concept will be re-
moved if it belongs to a category that is not used
in the annotation. The third experiment used the
proofreaded corpus with all abbreviations anno-
tated. The fourth experiment was conducted on
the proofread corpus allowing both exact match-
ing and partial matching. The results are outlined
in Table 4.

The lexicon lookup without pruning the ter-
minologies achieved low precision and extremely
low recall. This is mainly due to the ambiguous
terms in the lexicon. By removing unrelated terms
and categories in the lexicon, both precision and
recall improved dramatically. Proofreading, cor-
recting a large number of unknown tokens such as
spelling errors or irregular conventions further in-
creased both precision and recall. The 14.72 gain
in recall mainly came from resolution and expan-
sion of shorthand, abbreviations, and acronyms in
the notes. This also suggest that this kind of clin-
ical notes are very noisy, and require a consider-

23



able amount of effort in pre-processing. Allow-
ing partial matching increased recall by 7.18, but
decreased precision by 5.52, and gave the overall
increase of 2.47 F-score. Partial matching discov-
ered a larger number of matching candidates us-
ing a looser matching criteria, therefore decreased
in precision with compensation of an increase in
recall.

The highest precision achieved by exact match-
ing is 74.81, confirming that the lexical lookup
method is an effective means of identifying clin-
ical concepts. However, it requires extensive ef-
fort on pre-processing both corpus and the termi-
nology and is not easily adapted to other corpora.
The lexical matching fails to identify long terms
and has difficult in term disambiguation. The low
recall is caused by incompleteness of the terminol-
ogy. However, the benefit of using lexicon lookup
is that the system is able to assign a concept iden-
tifier to the identified concept if available.

6.2 CRF Feature Performance

The CRF system has been evaluated using 10-fold
cross validation on the data set. The evaluation
was performed using the CoNLL shared task eval-
uation script 3.

The CRF classifier experiment results are
shown in Table 5. A baseline system was built
using only bag-of-word features from the training
corpus. A context-window size of 2 and tag pre-
diction of previous token were used in all experi-
ments. Without using any contextual features the
performance was 48.04% F-score. The baseline
performance of 71.16% F-score outperformed the
lexical-look up performance. Clearly the contex-
tual information surrounding the concepts gives a
strong contribution in identification of concepts,
while lexical-lookup hardly uses any contextual
information.

The full system is built using all features de-
scribed in Section 5.2, and achieved the best result
of 81.48% F-score. This is a significant improve-
ment of 10.32% F-score over the baseline system.
Further experimental analysis of the contribution
of feature types was conducted by removing each
feature type from the full system. −bow means
bag-of-word features are removed from the full
system. The results show only bow and lexical-
lookup features make significant contribution to
the system, which are 5.49% and 4.40% sepa-

rately. Bigram, orthographic, affixes and abbrevi-
ation features each makes around ∼ 1% contribu-
tion to the F-score, which is individually insignif-
icant, however the combination of them makes a
significant contribution, which is 4.83% F-score.

The most effective feature in the system is the
output from the lexical lookup system. Another
experiment using only bow and lexical-lookup fea-
tures showed a boost of 7.39% F-score. This is
proof of the hypothesis that using terminology in-
formation in the machine learner would increase
recall. In this corpus, about one third of the con-
cepts has a frequency of only 1, from which the
learner as unable to learn anything from the train-
ing data. The gain in performance is due to the
ingestion of semantic domain knowledge which is
provided by the terminology. This knowledge is
useful for determining the correct boundary of a
concept as well as the classification of the concept.

6.3 Detailed CRF Performance

The detailed results of the CRF system are shown
in Table 6. Precision, Recall and F-score for each
class are reported. There is a consistent gap be-
tween Recall and Precision across all categories.
The best performing classes are among the most
frequent categories. This is an indication that suf-
ficient training data is a crucial factor in achieving
high performance. SUBSTANCE, PROCEDURE and
FINDING are the best three categories due to their
high frequency in the corpus. However, QUALI-
FIER achieved a lower F-score because qualifiers
usually appear at the boundaries of two concepts,
which is a source of error in boundary recognition.

Low frequency categories generally achieved
high precision and low recall. The recall decreases
as the number of training instances decreases, be-

cause there is not enough information in the train-
ing data to learn the class profiles. It is a chal-
lenge to boost the recall of rare categories due to
the variability of the terms in the notes. It is not
likely that the term would match to the terminol-
ogy, and hence there would be no utilisation of the
semantic information.

Another factor that causes recognition errors is
the nested concepts. BODY achieved the least pre-
cision because of the high frequency of nested
concepts in its category. The nested construction
also causes boundary detection problems, for ex-
ample C5/6 cervical discectomy PROCEDURE is
annotated as C5/6 BODY and cervical discectomy
PROCEDURE.

The results presented here are higher than those
reported in biomedical NER system. Although it
is difficult to compare with other work because of
the different data set, but this task might be easier
due to the shorter length of the concepts and fewer
long concepts (avg. 1.49 in this corpus vs. avg.
1.70 token per concept in GENIA). Local features
would be able to capture most of the useful infor-
mation while not introducing ambiguity.

7 Future Work and Conclusion

This paper presents a study of identification of
concepts in progressive clinical notes, which is
another genre of text that hasn’t been studied to
date. This is the first step towards information ex-
traction of free text clinical notes and knowledge
representation of patient cases. Now that the cor-
pus has been annotated with coarse grained con-
cept categories in a reference terminology, a pos-
sible improvement of the annotation is to reevalu-
ate the concept categories and create fine grained
categories by dividing top categories into smaller

classes along the terminology’s hierarchy. For ex-
ample, the FINDING class can be further divided
into SYMPTOM/SIGN, DISORDER and EVALUA-
TION RESULTS. The aim would be to achieve bet-
ter consistency, less ambiguity and greater cover-
age of the concepts in the corpus.

The nested concepts model the relations be-
tween atomic concepts within the outermost con-
cepts. These structures represent important rela-
tionships within this type of clinical concept. The
next piece of work could be the study of these rela-
tionships. They can be extended to represent rela-
tionships between clinical concepts and allow for
representing new concepts using structured infor-
mation. The annotation of relations is under de-
velopment. The future work will move from con-
cept identification to relation identification and au-
tomatic ontology extension.

Preliminary experiments in clinical named en-
tity recognition using both rule-based and machine
learning approaches were performed on this cor-
pus. These experiments have achieved promising
results and show that rule based lexicon lookup,
with considerable effort on pre-processing and
lexical verification, can significantly improve per-
formance over a simple exact matching process.
However, a machine learning system can achieve
good results by simply adapting features from
biomedical NER systems, and produced a mean-
ingful baseline for future research. A direction
to improve the recogniser is to add more syntac-
tic features and semantic features by using depen-
dency parsers and exploiting the unlabeled 60 mil-
lion token corpus.

In conclusion, this paper described a new anno-
tated corpus in the clinical domain and presented
initial approaches to clinical named entity recog-
nition. It has demonstrated that practical accept-
able named entity recognizer can be trained on the
corpus with an F-score of 81.48%. The challenge
in this task is to increase recall and identify rare
entity classes as well as resolve ambiguities intro-
duced by nested concepts. The results should be
improved by using extensive knowledge resource
or by increasing the size and improving the quality
of the corpus.
