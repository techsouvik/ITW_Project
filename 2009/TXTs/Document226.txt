Abstract

Parallel corpora are made by human be-
ings. However, as an MT system is an
aggregation of state-of-the-art NLP tech-
nologies without any intervention of hu-
man beings, it is unavoidable that quite a
few sentence pairs are beyond its analy-
sis and that will therefore not contribute
to the system. Furthermore, they in turn
may act against our objectives to make the
overall performance worse. Possible unfa-
vorable items are n : m mapping objects,
such as paraphrases, non-literal transla-
tions, and multiword expressions. This
paper presents a pre-processing method
which detects such unfavorable items be-
fore supplying them to the word aligner
under the assumption that their frequency
is low, such as below 5 percent. We show
an improvement of Bleu score from 28.0
to 31.4 in English-Spanish and from 16.9
to 22.1 in German-English.

1 Introduction

Phrase alignment (Marcu and Wong, 02) has re-
cently attracted researchers in its theory, although
it remains in infancy in its practice. However, a
phrase extraction heuristic such as grow-diag-final
(Koehn et al., 05; Och and Ney, 03), which is a sin-
gle difference between word-based SMT (Brown
et al., 93) and phrase-based SMT (Koehn et al.,
03) where we construct word-based SMT by bi-
directional word alignment, is nowadays consid-
ered to be a key process which leads to an over-
all improvement of MT systems. However, tech-
nically, this phrase extraction process after word
alignment is known to have at least two limita-
tions: 1) the objectives of uni-directional word
alignment is limited only in 1 : n mappings and
2) an atomic unit of phrase pair used by phrase ex-

traction is thus basically restricted in 1 : n or n : 1
with small exceptions.

Firstly, the posterior-based approach (Liang,
06) looks at the posterior probability and partially
delays the alignment decision. However, this ap-
proach does not have any extension in its 1 : n
uni-directional mappings in its word alignment.
Secondly, the aforementioned phrase alignment
(Marcu and Wong, 02) considers the n : m map-
ping directly bilingually generated by some con-
cepts without word alignment. However, this ap-
proach has severe computational complexity prob-
lems. Thirdly, linguistic motivated phrases, such
as a tree aligner (Tinsley et al., 06), provides n : m
mappings using some information of parsing re-
sults. However, as the approach runs somewhat in
a reverse direction to ours, we omit it from the dis-
cussion. Hence, this paper will seek for the meth-
ods that are different from those approaches and
whose computational cost is cheap.

n : m mappings in our discussion include para-
phrases (Callison-Burch, 07; Lin and Pantel, 01),
non-literal translations (Imamura et al., 03), mul-
tiword expressions (Lambert and Banchs, 05), and
some other noise in one side of a translation pair
(from now on, we call these ‘outliers’, meaning
that these are not systematic noise). One com-
mon characteristic of these n : m mappings is
that they tend to be so flexible that even an ex-
haustive list by human beings tends to be incom-
plete (Lin and Pantel, 01). There are two cases
which we should like to distinguish: when we use
external resources and when we do not. For ex-
ample, Quirk et al. employ external resources by
drawing pairs of English sentences from a compa-
rable corpus (Quirk et al., 04), while Bannard and
Callison-Burch (Bannard and Callison-Burch, 05)
identified English paraphrases by pivoting through
phrases in another language. However, in this pa-
per our interest is rather the case when our re-
sources are limited within our parallel corpus.

72



Imamura et al. (Imamura et al., 03), on the other
hand, do not use external resources and present a
method based on literalness measure called TCR
(Translation Correspondence Rate). Let us de-
fine literal translation as a word-to-word transla-
tion, and non-literal translation as a non word-to-
word translation. Literalness is defined as a de-
gree of literal translation. Literalness measure of
Imamura et al. is trained from a parallel corpus
using word aligned results, and then sentences are
selected which should either be translated by a ‘lit-
eral translation’ decoder or by a ‘non-literal trans-
lation’ decoder based on this literalness measure.
Apparently, their definition of literalness measure
is designed to be high recall since this measure
incorporates all the possible correspondence pairs
(via realizability of lexical mappings) rather than
all the possible true positives (via realizability of
sentences). Adding to this, the notion of literal
translation may be broader than this. For exam-
ple, literal translation of “C’est la vie.” in French
is “That’s life.” or “It is the life.” in English.
If literal translation can not convey the original
meaning correctly, non-literal translation can be
applied: “This is just the way life is.”, “That’s how
things happen.”, “Love story.”, and so forth. Non-
literal translation preserves the original meaning1

as much as possible, ignoring the exact word-to-
word correspondence. As is indicated by this ex-
ample, the choice of literal translation or non-
literal translation seems rather a matter of trans-
lator preference.

This paper presents a pre-processing method us-
ing the alternative literalness score aiming for high
precision. We assume that the percentages of these
n : m mappings are relatively low. Finally, it
turned out that if we focus on outlier ratio, this
method becomes a well-known sentence cleaning
approach. We refer to this in Section 5.

This paper is organized as follows. Section 2
outlines the 1 : n characteristics of word align-
ment by IBM Model 4. Section 3 reviews an
atomic unit of phrase extraction. Section 4 ex-
plains our Good Points Algorithm. Experimen-
tal results are presented in Section 5. Section 6
discusses a sentence cleaning algorithm. Section
7 concludes and provides avenues for further re-
search.

Figure 1: Figures A and C show the results of
word alignment for DE-EN where outliers de-
tected by Algorithm 1 are shown in blue at the bot-
tom. We check all the alignment cept pairs in the
training corpus inspecting so-called A3 final files
by type of alignment from 1:1 to 1:13 (or NULL
alignment). It is noted that outliers are miniscule
in A and C because each count is only 3 percent.
Most of them are NULL alignment or 1:1 align-
ment, while there are small numbers of alignments
with 1:3 and 1:4 (up to 1:13 in the DE-EN direc-
tion in Figure A). In Figure C, 1:11 is the greatest.
Figure B and D show the ratio of outliers over all
the counts. Figure B shows that in the case of 1:10
alignments, 1/2 of the alignments are considered
to be outliers by Algorithm 1, while 100 percent
of alignment from 1:11 to 1:13 are considered to
be outliers (false negative). Figure D shows that in
the case of EN-DE, most of the outlier ratios are
less than 20 percent.

2 1 : n Word Alignment

Our discussion of uni-directional alignments of
word alignment is limited to IBM Model 4.

Definition 1 (Word alignment task) Let ei be
the i-th sentence in target language, ēi,j be the j-
th word in i-th sentence, and ēi be the i-th word in
parallel corpus (Similarly for fi, ¯fi,j, and f̄i). Let
|ei| be a sentence length of ei, and similarly for
|fi|. We are given a pair of sentence aligned bilin-
gual texts (f1, e1), . . . , (fn, en) ∈ X × Y , where
fi = (f̄i,1, . . . , f̄i,|fi|) and ei = (ēi,1, . . . , ēi,|ei|).
It is noted that ei and fi may include more than
one sentence. The task of word alignment is to
find a lexical translation probability pf̄i : ēi →
pf̄j(ēi) such that Σpf̄j(ēi) = 1 and ∀ēi : 0 ≤
pf̄j(ēi) ≤ 1 (It is noted that some models such

as IBM Model 3 and 4 have deficiency problems).
It is noted that there may be several words in
source language and target language which do not
map to any words, which are called unaligned (or
null aligned) words. Triples (f̄i, ēi, pf̄i(ē1)) (or
(f̄i, ēi,− log10 pf̄i(ē1))) are called T-tables.

As the above definition shows, the purpose of
the word alignment task is to obtain a lexical
translation probability p(f̄i|ēi), which is a 1 : n
uni-directional word alignment. The initial idea
underlying the IBM Models, consisting of five
distinctive models, is that it introduces an align-
ment function a(j|i), or alternatively the distor-
tion function d(j|i) or d(j −⊙i), when the task is
viewed as a missing value problem, where i and j
denote the position of a cept in a sentence and ⊙i
denotes the center of a cept. d(j|i) denotes a dis-
tortion of the absolute position, while d(j−⊙i) de-
notes the distortion of relative position. Then this
missing value problem can be solved by EM algo-
rithms : E-step is to take expectation of all the pos-
sible alignments and M-step is to estimate maxi-
mum likelihood of parameters by maximizing the
expected likelihood obtained in the E-step. The
second idea of IBM Models is in the mechanism
of fertility and a NULL insertion, which makes the
performance of IBM Models competitive. Fertility
and a NULL insertion is used to adjust the length

3It is noted that there might be a criticism that this is not a
fair comparison because we do not have sufficient data. Un-
der a transductive setting (where we can access the test data),
we believe that our statement is valid. Considering the nature
of the 1 : n mapping, it would be quite lucky if we obtain
n : m mapping after phrase extraction (Our focus is not on
the incorrect probability, but rather on the incorrect match-
ing.)

n when the length of the source sentence is differ-
ent from this n. Fertility is a mechanism to aug-
ment one source word into several source words
or delete a source word, while a NULL insertion
is a mechanism of generating several words from
blank words. Fertility uses a conditional probabil-
ity depending only on the lexicon. For example,
the length of ‘today’ can be conditioned only on
the lexicon ‘today’.

As is already mentioned, the resulting align-
ments are 1 : n (shown in the upper figure in
Figure 1). For DE-EN News Commentary cor-
pus, most of the alignments fall in either 1:1 map-
ping or NULL mappings whereas small numbers
are 1:2 mappings and miniscule numbers are from
1:3 to 1:13. However, this 1 : n nature of word
alignment will cause problems if we encounter
n : m mapping objects, such as a paraphrase, non-
literal translation, or multiword expression. Figure
2 shows such difficulties where we show a mono-
lingual paraphrase. Without loss of generality this
can be easily extended to bilingual paraphrases. In
this case, results of word alignment are completely
wrong, with the exception of the example consist-
ing of a colon. Although these paraphrases, non-
literal translations, and multiword expressions do
not always become outliers, they may face the
potential danger of producing the incorrect word
alignments with incorrect probabilities.

3 Phrase Extraction and Atomic Unit of
Phrases

The phrase extraction is a process to exploit
phrases for a given bi-directional word alignment
(Koehn et al., 05; Och and Ney, 03). If we focus on
its generative process, this would become as fol-
lows: 1) add intersection of two word alignments
as an alignment point, 2) add new alignment points
that exist in the union with the constraint that a
new alignment point connects at least one previ-
ously unaligned word, 3) check the unaligned row
(or column) as unaligned row (or column, respec-
tively), 4) if n alignment points are contiguous in
horizontal (or vertical) direction we consider that
this is a contiguous 1 : n (or n : 1) phrase pair
(let us call these type I phrase pairs), 5) if a neigh-
borhood of a contiguous 1 : n phrase pair is (an)
unaligned row(s) or (an) unaligned column(s) we
grow this region (with consistency constraint) (let
us call these type II phrase pair), and 6) we con-
sider all the diagonal combinations of type I and

74



type II phrase pairs generatively.
The atomic unit of type I phrase pairs is 1 : n

or n : 1, while that of type II phrase pairs is n : m
if unaligned row(s) and column(s) exist in neigh-
borhood. So, whether they form a n : m map-
ping or not depends on the existence of unaligned
row(s) and column(s). And at the same time, n or
m should be restricted to a small value. There is
a chance that a n : m phrase pair can be created
in this way. This is because around one third of
word alignments, which is quite a large figure, are
1 : 0 as is shown in Figure 1. Nevertheless, our
concern is if the results of word alignment is very
low quality, e.g. similar to the situation depicted
in Figure 2, this mechanism will not work. Fur-
thermore, this mechanism is only restricted in the
unaligned row(s) and column(s).

4 Our Approach: Good Points Approach

Our approach aims at removing outliers by the lit-
eralness score, which we defined in Section 1, be-
tween a pair of sentences. Sentence pairs with low
literalness score should be removed. Following
two propositions are the theory behind this. Let
a word-based MT system be MWB and a phrase-
based MT system be MPB. Then,

Proposition 1 Under an ideal MT system MPB , a
paraphrase is an inlier (or realizable), and

Proposition 2 Under an ideal MT system MWB ,
a paraphrase is an outlier (or not realizable).

Based on these propositions, we could assume
that if we measure the literalness score under a
word-based MT MWB we will be able to deter-
mine the degree of outlier-ness whatever the mea-
sure we use for it. Hence, what we should do is,
initially, to score it under a word-based MT MWB
using Bleu, for example. (Later we replace it with
a variant of Bleu, i.e. cumulative n-gram score).
However, despite Proposition 1, our MT system
at hand is unfortunately not ideal. What we can
currently do is the following: if we witness bad
sentence-based scores in word-based MT, we can
consider our MT system failing to incorporating a
n : m mapping object for those sentences. Later
in our revised version, we use both of word-based
MT and phrase-based MT. The summary of our
first approach becomes as follows: 1) employing
the mechanism of word-based MT trained on the
same parallel corpus, we measure the literalness
between a pair of sentences, 2) we use the variants

Figure 3: Left figure shows sentence-based Bleu
score of word-based SMT and right figure shows
that of phrase-based SMT. Each row shows the cu-
mulative n-gram score (n = 1,2,3,4) and we use
News Commentary parallel corpus (DE-EN).

Figure 4: Each row shows Bleu, NIST, and TER,
while each column shows different language pairs
(EN-ES, EN-DE and FR-DE). These figures show
the scores of all the training sentences by the
word-based SMT system. In the row for Bleu,
note that the area of rectangle shows the num-
ber of sentence pairs whose Bleu scores are zero.
(There are a lot of sentence pairs whose Bleu score
are zero: if we draw without en-folding the coor-
dinate, these heights reach to 25,000 to 30,000.)
There is a smooth probability distribution in the
middle, while there are two non-smoothed connec-
tions at 1.0 and 0.0. Notice there is a small num-
ber of sentences whose score is 1.0. In the middle
row for NIST score, similarly, there is a smooth
probability distribution in the middle and we have
a non-smoothed connection at 0.0. In the bottom
row for TER score, the 0.0 is the best score unlike
Bleu and NIST, and we omit scores more than 2.5
in these figures. (The maximum was 27.0.)

75



of Bleu score as the measure of literalness, and
3) based on this score, we reduce the sentences in
parallel corpus. Our algorithm is as follows:

Algorithm 1 Good Points Algorithm
Step 1: Train word-based MT.
Step 2: Translate all training sentences by the
above trained word-based MT decoder.
Step 3: Obtain the cumulative X-gram score for
each pair of sentences where X is 4, 3, 2, and 1.
Step 4: By the threshold described in Table 1,
we produce new reduced parallel corpus.
(Step 5: Do the whole procedure of phrase-
based SMT using the reduced parallel corpus
which we obtain from Step 1 to 4.)

We would like to mention our motivation for
choosing the variant of Bleu. In Step 3 we
need to set up a threshold in MWB to determine
outliers. Natural intuition is that this distribu-
tion takes some smooth distribution as Bleu takes
weighted geometric mean. However, as is shown

Figure 5: Four figures show the sentence-based
cumulative n-gram scores: x-axis is phrase-based
SMT and y-axis is word-based SMT. Focus is on
the worst point (0,0) where both scores are zero.
Many points reside in (0,0) in cumulative 4-gram
scores, while only small numbers of point reside
in (0,0) in cumulative 1-gram scores.

in the first row of Figure 4, typical distribution of
words in this space MWB is separated in two clus-
ters: one looks like a geometric distribution and
the other one contains a lot of points whose value
is zero. (Especially in the case of Bleu, if the sen-
tence length is less than 3 the Bleu score is zero.)
For this reason, we use the variants of Bleu score:
we decompose Bleu score in cumulative n-gram
score (n=1,2,3,4), which is shown in Figure 3. It is
noted that the following relation holds: S4(e, f) ≤
S3(e, f) ≤ S2(e, f) ≤ S1(e, f) where e denotes
an English sentence, f denotes a foreign sentence,
and SX denotes cumulative X-gram scores. For 3-
gram scores, the tendency to separate in two clus-
ters is slightly decreased. Furthermore, for 1-gram
scores, the distribution approaches to normal dis-
tribution. We model P(outlier) taking care of the
quantity of S2(e, f), where we choose 0.1: other
configurations in Table 1 are used in experiments.
It is noted that although we choose the variants
of Bleu score, it is clear, in this context, that we
can replace Bleu with any other measure, such as
METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 05), NIST (Dod-
dington, 02), GTM (Melamed et al., 03), TER
(Snover et al., 06), labeled dependency approach
(Owczarzak et al., 07) and so forth (see Figure 4).
Table 2 shows outliers detected by Algorithm 1.

Finally, a revised algorithm which incorporates
sentence-based X-gram scores of phrase-based
MT is shown in Algorithm 2. Figure 5 tells us

76



that there are many sentence pair scores actually
improved in phrase-based MT even if word-based
score is zero.

Algorithm 2 Revised Good Points Algorithm
Step 1: Train word-based MT for full parallel
corpus. Translate all training sentences by the
above trained word-based MT decoder.
Step 2: Obtain the cumulative X-gram score
SWB,X for each pair of sentences where X is
4, 3, 2, and 1 for word-based MT decoder.
Step 3: Train phrase-based MT for full parallel
corpus. Note that we do not need to run a word
aligner again in here, but use the results of Step
1. Translate all training sentences by the above
trained phrase-based MT decoder.
Step 4: Obtain the cumulative X-gram score
SPB,X for each pair of sentences where X is
4, 3, 2, and 1 for phrase-based MT decoder.
Step 5: Remove sentences whose (SWB,2,
SPB,2) = (0, 0). We produce new reduced par-
allel corpus.
(Step 6: Do the whole procedure of phrase-
based SMT using the reduced parallel corpus
which we obtain from Step 1 to 5.)

We evaluate our algorithm using the News Com-
mentary parallel corpus used in 2007 Statistical

provided by this workshop. We use Moses (Koehn

et al., 07) as the baseline system, with mgiza (Gao
and Vogel, 08) as its word alignment tool. We do
MERT in all the experiments below.

Step 1 of Algorithm 1 produces, for a given
parallel corpus, a word-based MT. We do this us-
ing Moses with option max-phrase-length set to 1,
alignment as union as we would like to extract the
bi-directional results of word alignment with high
recall. Although we have chosen union, other se-
lection options may be possible as Table 3 sug-
gests. Performance of this word-based MT system
is as shown in Table 4.

Step 2 is to obtain the cumulative n-gram score
for the entire training parallel corpus by using the
word-based MT system trained in Step 1. Table 5
shows the first two sentences of News Commen-
tary corpus. We score for all the sentence pairs.

Table 5: Four figures marked as score shows the
cumulative n-gram score from left to right. The
following EN and FR are the calculated sentences
used by word-based MT system trained on Step 1.

In Step 3, we obtain the cumulative n-gram
score (shown in Figure 3). As is already men-
tioned, there are a lot of sentence pairs whose cu-
mulative 4-gram score is zero. In the cumulative
3-gram score, this tendency is slightly decreased.
For 1-gram scores, the distribution approaches to
normal distribution. In Step 4, other than our con-
figuration we used 8 different configurations in Ta-
ble 6 to reduce our parallel corpus.

Now we obtain the reduced parallel corpus. In
Step 5, using this reduced parallel corpus we car-
ried out training of MT system from the begin-
ning: we again started from the word alignment,
followed by phrase extraction, and so forth. The
results corresponding to these configurations are
shown in Table 6. In Table 6, in the case of

English-Spanish our configuration discards 3.46
percent of sentences, and the performance reaches
0.314 which is the best among other configura-
tions. Similarly in the case of German-English our
configuration attains the best performance among
configurations. It is noted that results for the base-
line system are shown in Table 8 where we picked
up the score where n is 100. It is noted that the
baseline system as well as other configurations use
MERT. Similarly, results for a revised Good Points

Figure 6: Three figures in the left show the his-
togram of sentence length (main figures) and his-
togram of sentence length of outliers (at the bot-
tom). (As the numbers of outliers are less than
5 percent in each case, outliers are miniscule. In
the case of EN-ES, we can observe the blue small
distributions at the bottom from 2 to 16 sentence
length.) Three figures in the right show that if we
see this by ratio of outliers over all the counts, all
of three figures tend to be more than 20 to 30 per-
cent from 80 to 100 sentence length. The lower
two figures show that sentence length 1 to 4 tend
to be more than 10 percent.

Algorithm is shown in Table 7.

6 Discussion

In Section 1, we mentioned that if we aim at out-
lier ratio using the indirect feature sentence length,
this method reduces to a well-known sentence
cleaning approach shown below in Algorithm 3.

Algorithm 3 Sentence Cleaning Algorithm
Remove sentences with lengths greater than X
(or remove sentences with lengths smaller than
X in the case of short sentences).

This approach is popular although the reason
behind why this approach works is not well un-
derstood. Our explanation is shown in the right-
hand side of Figure 6 where outliers are shown at
the bottom (almost invisible) which are extracted
by Algorithm 1. The region that Algorithm 3 re-
moves via sentence length X is possibly the region
where the ratio of outliers is high.

This method is a high recall method. This
method does not check whether the removed sen-
tences are really sentences whose behavior is bad
or not. For example, look at Figure 6 for sen-

tence length 10 to 30 where there are considerably
many outliers in the region that a lot of inliers re-
side. However, this method cannot cope with such
outliers. Instead, the method cope with the region
that the outlier ratio is possibly high at both ends,
e.g. sentence length > 60 or sentence length < 5.
The advantage is that sentence length information
is immediately available from the sentence which
is easy to implement. The results of this algorithm
is shown in Table 8 where we varies X and lan-
guage pair. This table also suggests that we should
refrain from saying that X = 60 is best or X = 80
is best.

7 Conclusions and Further Work

This paper shows some preliminary results that
data cleaning may be a useful pre-processing tech-
nique for word alignment. At this moment, we ob-
serve two positive results, improvement of Bleu
score from 28.0 to 31.4 in English-Spanish and
16.9 to 22.1 in German-English which are shown
in Table 6. Our method checks the realizability of
target sentences in training sentences. If we wit-
ness bad cumulative X-gram scores we suspect
that this is due to some problems caused by the
n : m mapping objects during word alignment fol-
lowed by phrase extraction process.

Firstly, although we removed training sentences

whose n-gram scores are low, we can dupli-
cate such training sentences in word alignment.
This method is appealing, but unfortunately if we
use mgiza or GIZA++, our training process of-
ten ceased in the middle by unrecognized errors.
However, if we succeed in training, the results of-
ten seem comparable to our results. Although we
did not supply back removed sentences, it is pos-
sible to examine such sentences using the T-tables
to extract phrase pairs.

Secondly, it seems that one of the key matters
lies in the quantities of n : m mapping objects
which are difficult to learn by word-based MT (or
by phrase-based MT). It is possible that such quan-
tities are different depending on their language
pairs and on their corpora size. A rough estimation
is that this quantity may be somewhere less than
10 percent (in FR-EN Hansard corpus, recall and
precision reach around 90 percent (Moore, 05)),
or less than 5 percent (in News Commentary cor-
pus, the best Bleu scores by Algorithm 1 are when
this percentage is less than 5 percent ). As further
study, we intend to examine this issue further.

Thirdly, this method has other aspects that it
removes discontinuous points: such discontinu-
ous points may relate to the smoothness of opti-
mization surface. One of the assumptions of the
method such as Wang et al. (Wang et al., 07) re-
lates to smoothness. Then, our method may im-
prove their results, which is our further study.

In addition, although our algorithm runs a word
aligner more than once, this process can be re-
duced since removed sentences are less than 5 per-
cent or so.

Finally, we did not compare our method with
TCR of Imamura. In our case, the focus was 2-
gram scores rather than other n-gram scores. We
intend to investigate this further.
