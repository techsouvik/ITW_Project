Abstract 

In this demo, we present a wiki-style platform – 

WikiBABEL – that enables easy collaborative 

creation of multilingual content in many non-

English Wikipedias, by leveraging the relatively 

larger and more stable content in the English 

Wikipedia.  The platform provides an intuitive 

user interface that maintains the user focus on 

the multilingual Wikipedia content creation, by 

engaging search tools for easy discoverability of 

related English source material, and a set of lin-

guistic and collaborative tools to make the con-

tent translation simple.  We present two different 

usage scenarios and discuss our experience in 

testing them with real users.  Such integrated 

content creation platform in Wikipedia may yield 

as a by-product, parallel corpora that are critical 

for research in statistical machine translation sys-

tems in many languages of the world.   

1 Introduction 

Parallel corpora are critical for research in many 

natural language processing systems, especially, 

the Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) and 

Crosslingual Information Retrieval (CLIR) sys-

tems, as the state-of-the-art systems are based on 

statistical learning principles; a typical SMT sys-

tem in a pair of language requires large parallel 

corpora, in the order of a few million parallel 

sentences.  Parallel corpora are traditionally 

created by professionals (in most cases, for busi-

ness or governmental needs) and are available 

only in a few languages of the world.  The prohi-

bitive cost associated with creating new parallel 

data implied that the SMT research was re-

stricted to only a handful of languages of the 

world.  To make such research possible widely, it 

is important that innovative and inexpensive 

ways of creating parallel corpora are found.  Our 

research explores such an avenue: by involving 

the user community in creation of parallel data. 

In this demo, we present a community colla-

boration platform – WikiBABEL – which 

enables the creation of multilingual content in 

Wikipedia.  WikiBABEL leverages two signifi-

cant facts with respect to Wikipedia data: First, 

there is a large skew between the content of Eng-

lish and non-English Wikipedias.  Second, while 

the original content creation requires subject 

matter experts, subsequent translations may be 

effectively created by people who are fluent in 

English and the target language.  In general, we 

do expect the large English Wikipedia to provide 

source material for multilingual Wikipedias; 

however on specific topics specific multilingual 

Wikipedia may provide the source material 

(http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/俳句 may be better 
than http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/haiku).   We 

leverage these facts in the WikiBABEL frame-

work, enabling a community of interested native 

speakers of a language, to create content in their 

respective language Wikipedias.  We make such 

content creation easy by integrating linguistic 

tools and resources for translation, and collabora-

tive mechanism for storing and sharing know-

ledge among the users.  Such methodology is 

expected to generate comparable data (similar, 

but not the same content), from which parallel 

data may be mined subsequently (Munteanu et 

al, 2005) (Quirk et al, 2007).   

We present here the WikiBABEL platform, 

and trace its evolution through two distinct usage 

versions: First, as a standalone deployment pro-

viding a community of users a translation plat-

form on hosted Wikipedia data to generate paral-

lel corpora, and second, as a transparent edit 

layer on top of Wikipedias to generate compara-

ble corpora.  Both paradigms were used for user 

testing, to gauge the usability of the tool and the 

viability of the approach for content creation in 

multilingual Wikipedias.  We discuss the imple-

mentations and our experience with each of the 

above scenarios.  Such experience may be very 

valuable in fine-tuning methodologies for com-

munity creation of various types of linguistic 

data.  Community contributed efforts may per-

haps be the only way to collect sufficient corpora 

effectively and economically, to enable research 

in many resource-poor languages of the world.

2 Architecture of WikiBABEL 

The architecture of WikiBABEL is as illustrated 

in Figure 1: Central to the architecture is the Wi-

kiBABEL component that coordinates the interac-

tion between its linguistic and collaboration 

components, and the users and the Wikipedia 

system.  WikiBABEL architecture is designed to 

support a host of linguistic tools and resources 

that may be helpful in the content creation 

process: Bilingual dictionaries for providing for 

word-level translations, allowing user customiza-

tion of domain-specific, or even, user-specific 

bilingual dictionaries.  Also available are ma-

chine translation and transliteration systems for 

rough initial translation [or transliteration] of a 

source language string at sentential/phrasal levels 

[or names] to the intended target language.  As 

the quality of automatic translations are rarely 

close to human quality translations, the user may 

need to correct any such automatically translated 

or transliterated content, and an intuitive edit 

framework provides tools for such corrections.  

A collaborative translation memory component 

stores all the user corrections (or, sometimes, 

their selection from a set of alternatives) of ma-

chine translations, and makes them available to 

the community as a translation help („tribe know-

ledge‟).  Voting mechanisms are available that 

may prioritize more frequently chosen alterna-

tives as preferred suggestions for subsequent us-

ers.  The user-management tracks the user de-

mographic information, and their contributions 

(its quality and quantity) for possible recogni-

tion.  The user interface features are imple-

mented as light-weight components, requiring 

minimal server-side interaction.  Finally, the ar-

chitecture is designed open, to integrate any user-

developed tools and resources easily.  

 

 

 

3 WikiBABEL on Wikipedia 

IN this section we discuss Wikipedia content and 

user characteristics and outline our experience 

with the two versions on Wikipedia.   

3.1 Wikipedia: User & Data Characteristics 

Wikipedia content is acknowledged to be on par 

with the best of the professionally created re-

sources (Giles, 2005) and is used regularly as 

academic reference (Rainie et al., 2007).  How-

ever, there is a large disparity in content between 

English and other language Wikipedias. English 

Wikipedia - the largest - has about 3.5 Million 

topics, but with an exception of a dozen or so 

Western European and East Asian languages, 

most of the 250-odd languages have less than 1% 

of English Wikipedia content (Wikipedia, 2009).  

Such skew, despite the size of the respective user 

population, indicates a large room for growth in 

many multilingual Wikipedias.  On the contribu-

tion side, Wikipedia has about 200,000 contribu-

tors (> 10 total contributions); but only about 4% 

of them are very active (> 100 contributions per 

month).  The general perception that a few very 

active users contributed to the bulk of Wikipedia 

was disputed in a study (Swartz, 2006) that 

claims that large fraction of the content were 

created by those who made very few or occa-

sional contributions that are primarily editorial in 

nature.  It is our strategy to provide a platform 

for easy multilingual Wikipedia content creation 

that may be harvested for parallel data.   

3.2 Version 1: A Hosted Portal 

In our first version, a set of English Wikipedia 

topics (stable non-controversial articles, typically 

from Medicine, Healthcare, Science & Technol-

ogy, Literature, etc.) were chosen and hosted in 

our WikiBABEL portal.  Such set of articles is 

already available as Featured Articles in most 

Wikipedias.  English Wikipedia has a set of 

~1500 articles that are voted by the community 

as stable and well written, spanning many do-

mains, such as, Literature, Philosophy, History, 

Science, Art, etc.  The user can choose any of 

these Wikipedia topics to translate to the target 

language and correct the machine translation er-

rors.  Once a topic is chosen, a two-pane window 

is presented to the user, as shown in Figure 2, in 

which the original English Wikipedia article is 

shown in the left panel and a rough translation of 

the same article in the user-chosen target lan-

guage is presented in the right panel.  The right 

panel has the same look and feel as the original 

30



English Wikipedia article, and is editable, while 

the left panel is primarily intended for providing 

source material for reference and context, for the 

translation correction.  On mouse-over the paral-

lel sentences are highlighted, linking visually the 

related text on both panels.  On a mouse-click, an 

edit-box is opened in-place in the right panel, 

and the current content may be edited.  As men-

tioned earlier, integrated linguistic tools and re-

sources may be invoked during edit process, to 

help the user.  Once the article reaches sufficient 

quality as judged by the users, the content may 

be transferred to target language Wikipedia, ef-

fectively creating a new topic in the target lan-

guage Wikipedia. 

User Feedback: We field tested our first ver-

sion with a set of Wikipedia users, and a host of 

amateur and professional translators.  The prima-

ry feedback we got was that such efforts to create 

content in multilingual Wikipedia was well ap-

preciated.  The testing provided much quantita-

tive (in terms of translation time, effort, etc.) and 

qualitative (user experience) measures and feed-

back.  The details are available in (Kumaran et 

al., 2008), and here we provide highlights only: 

 Integrated linguistic resources (e.g., bilingual 
dictionaries, transliteration systems, etc.) 

were appreciated by all users. 

 Amateur users used the automatic translations 
(in direct correlation with its quality), and 

improved their throughput up to 40%.  

 In contrast, those who were very fluent in 
both the languages were distracted by the 

quality of translations, and were slowed by 

30%.  In most cases, they preferred to redo 

the entire translations, rather than considering 

and correcting the rough translation.  

 One qualitative feedback from the Wikipedia 
community is that the sentence-by-sentence 

translation enforced by the portal is not in 

tune with their philosophy of user-decided 

content for the target topic.  

We used the feedback from the version 1, to re-

design WikiBABEL in version 2. 

3.3 Version 2: As a Transparent Edit Layer 

In our second version, we implemented the 

significant feedback from Wikipedians, pertain-

ing to source content selection and the user con-

tribution.  In this version, we delivered the Wi-

kiBABEL experience as an add-on to Wikipedia, 

as a semi-transparent overlay that augments the 

basic Wikipedia edit capabilities without taking 

the contributor away from the site. Capable of 

being launched with one click (via a bookmark-

let, or a browser plug-in, or as a potential server 

side integration with Wikipedia), the new version 

offered a more seamless workflow and integrated 

linguistic and collaborative components.  This 

add-on may be invoked on Wikipedia itself, pro-

viding all WikiBABEL functionalities.  In a typi-

cal WikiBABEL usage scenario, a Wikipedia 

31



content creator may be at an English Wikipedia 

article for which no corresponding article exists 

in the target language, or at target language Wi-

kipedia article which has much less content 

compared to the corresponding English article.  

The WikiBABEL user interface in this version 

is as shown in Figure 3.  The source English Wi-

kipedia article is shown in the left panel tabs, and 

may be toggled between English and the target 

language; also it may be viewed in HTML or in 

Wiki-markup.  The right panel shows the target 

language Wikipedia article (if it exists), or a 

newly created stub (otherwise); either case, the 

right panel presents a native target language Wi-

kipedia edit page, for the chosen topic.  The left 

panel content is used as a reference for content 

creation in target language Wikipedia in the right 

panel.  The user may compose the target lan-

guage Wikipedia article, either by dragging-and-

dropping translated content from the left to the 

right panel (into the target language Wikipedia 

editor), or add new content as a typical Wikipe-

dia user would.  To enable the user to stay within 

WikiBABEL for their content research, we have 

provided the capability to search through other 

Wikipedia articles in the left panel.  All linguistic 

and collaborative features are available to the 

users in the right panel, as in the previous ver-

sion.  The default target language Wikipedia pre-

view is at any time.  While the user testing of this 

implementation is still in the preliminary stages, 

we wish to make the following observations on 

the methodology: 

 There is a marked shift of focus from 
“translation from English Wikipedia article” 

to “content creation in target Wikipedia”. 

 The user is never taken away from Wiki-
pedia site, requiring optionally only Wikipe-

dia credentials. The content is created direct-

ly in the target Wikipedia. 

 

The WikiBABEL Version 2 prototype will be 

made available externally in the future.
