1 Introduction 
This tutorial gives an introduction to the funda-
mentals of Chinese language processing for text 
processing. Today, more and more Chinese in-
formation are available in electronic form and 
over the internet. Computer processing of Chi-
nese text requires the understanding of both the 
language itself and the technology to handle 
them. This tutorial is targeted for both Chinese 
linguists who are interested in computational 
linguistics and computer scientists who are inter-
ested in research on processing Chinese.  

2 Content Overview 
This tutorial consists of two parts. The first part 
overviews the grammar of the Chinese language 
from a language processing perspective based on 
naturally occurring data. The second part over-
views Chinese specific processing issues and 
corresponding computational technologies. 

The grammar introduced is a descriptive 
grammar of general-purpose, present-day stan-
dard Mandarin Chinese, which is fast becoming 
an internationally spoken language. Real exam-
ples of actual language use will be illustrated 
based on a data driven and corpus based ap-
proach so that its links to computational linguis-
tic approaches for computer processing are natu-
rally bridged in. A number of important Chinese 
NLP resources are also presented. On the tech-
nology side, the tutorial mainly covers Chinese 
word segmentation and Part-of-Speech tagging. 
Word segmentation problem has to deal with 
some Chinese language unique problems such as 
unknown word detection and named entity rec-
ognition which are the emphasis of this tutorial.  

3 Tutorial Outline  
Part 1: Highlights of Chinese Grammar for NLP 

1.1 Preliminaries: Orthography and writing 
conventions 

 

1.2 Basic unit of processing: word or character? 
a. Word-forms vs. character forms 

 b. Word-senses vs. character-senses 
1.3 Part-of-Speech: important issues in defin-

ing word classes 
1.4 Word formation: from affixation to com-

pounding  
1.5 Unique constructions and challenges 

a. Classifier-noun agreement 
b. Separable compounds (or ionization) 

 c. ‘Verbless’ Constructions 
1.6. Chinese NLP resources  

 
Part 2: Text Processing 

2.1 Lexical processing 
 a. Segmentation 
 b. Disambiguation 
 c. Unknown word detection 
 d. Named Entity Recognition 
2.2 Syntactic processing
