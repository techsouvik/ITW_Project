1 Introduction

In this tutorial I will introduce ‘learning to rank’,
a machine learning technology on constructing a
model for ranking objects using training data. I
will first explain the problem formulation of learn-
ing to rank, and relations between learning to
rank and the other learning tasks. I will then de-
scribe learning to rank methods developed in re-
cent years, including pointwise, pairwise, and list-
wise approaches. I will then give an introduction
to the theoretical work on learning to rank and the
applications of learning to rank. Finally, I will
show some future directions of research on learn-
ing to rank. The goal of this tutorial is to give the
audience a comprehensive survey to the technol-
ogy and stimulate more research on the technol-
ogy and application of the technology to natural
language processing.

Learning to rank has been successfully applied
to information retrieval and is potentially useful
for natural language processing as well. In fact
many NLP tasks can be formalized as ranking
problems and NLP technologies may be signifi-
cantly improved by using learning to rank tech-
niques. These include question answering, sum-
marization, and machine translation. For exam-
ple, in machine translation, given a sentence in the
source language, we are to translate it to a sentence
in the target language. Usually there are multi-
ple possible translations and it would be better to
sort the possible translations in descending order
of their likelihood and output the sorted results.
Learning to rank can be employed in the task.
