Abstract
Existing evaluation metrics for machine translation
lack crucial robustness: their correlations with hu-
man quality judgments vary considerably across lan-
guages and genres. We believe that the main reason
is their inability to properly capture meaning: A good
translation candidate means the same thing as the
reference translation, regardless of formulation. We
propose a metric that evaluates MT output based on
a rich set of features motivated by textual entailment,
such as lexical-semantic (in-)compatibility and ar-
gument structure overlap. We compare this metric
against a combination metric of four state-of-the-
art scores (BLEU, NIST, TER, and METEOR) in
two different settings. The combination metric out-
performs the individual scores, but is bested by the
entailment-based metric. Combining the entailment
and traditional features yields further improvements.

1 Introduction

Constant evaluation is vital to the progress of ma-
chine translation (MT). Since human evaluation is
costly and difficult to do reliably, a major focus of
research has been on automatic measures of MT
quality, pioneered by BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002)
and NIST (Doddington, 2002). BLEU and NIST
measure MT quality by using the strong correla-
tion between human judgments and the degree of
n-gram overlap between a system hypothesis trans-
lation and one or more reference translations. The
resulting scores are cheap and objective.

However, studies such as Callison-Burch et al.
(2006) have identified a number of problems with
BLEU and related n-gram-based scores: (1) BLEU-
like metrics are unreliable at the level of individual
sentences due to data sparsity; (2) BLEU metrics
can be “gamed” by permuting word order; (3) for
some corpora and languages, the correlation to hu-
man ratings is very low even at the system level;
(4) scores are biased towards statistical MT; (5) the
quality gap between MT and human translations is
not reflected in equally large BLEU differences.

∗This paper is based on work funded by the Defense Ad-
vanced Research Projects Agency through IBM. The content
does not necessarily reflect the views of the U.S. Government,
and no official endorsement should be inferred.

This is problematic, but not surprising: The met-
rics treat any divergence from the reference as a
negative, while (computational) linguistics has long
dealt with linguistic variation that preserves the
meaning, usually called paraphrase, such as:

(1) HYP: However, this was declared terrorism
by observers and witnesses.

REF: Nevertheless, commentators as well as
eyewitnesses are terming it terrorism.

A number of metrics have been designed to account
for paraphrase, either by making the matching more
intelligent (TER, Snover et al. (2006)), or by using
linguistic evidence, mostly lexical similarity (ME-
TEOR, Banerjee and Lavie (2005); MaxSim, Chan
and Ng (2008)), or syntactic overlap (Owczarzak et
al. (2008); Liu and Gildea (2005)). Unfortunately,
each metrics tend to concentrate on one particu-
lar type of linguistic information, none of which
always correlates well with human judgments.

Our paper proposes two strategies. We first ex-
plore the combination of traditional scores into a
more robust ensemble metric with linear regression.
Our second, more fundamental, strategy replaces
the use of loose surrogates of translation quality
with a model that attempts to comprehensively as-
sess meaning equivalence between references and
MT hypotheses. We operationalize meaning equiv-
alence by bidirectional textual entailment (RTE,
Dagan et al. (2005)), and thus predict the qual-
ity of MT hypotheses with a rich RTE feature set.
The entailment-based model goes beyond existing
word-level “semantic” metrics such as METEOR
by integrating phrasal and compositional aspects
of meaning equivalence, such as multiword para-
phrases, (in-)correct argument and modification
relations, and (dis-)allowed phrase reorderings. We
demonstrate that the resulting metric beats both in-
dividual and combined traditional MT metrics. The
complementary features of both metric types can
be combined into a joint, superior metric.

2 Regression-based MT Quality Prediction

Current MT metrics tend to focus on a single dimen-
sion of linguistic information. Since the importance
of these dimensions tends not to be stable across
language pairs, genres, and systems, performance
of these metrics varies substantially. A simple strat-
egy to overcome this problem could be to combine
the judgments of different metrics. For example,
Paul et al. (2007) train binary classifiers on a fea-
ture set formed by a number of MT metrics. We
follow a similar idea, but use a regularized linear
regression to directly predict human ratings.

Feature combination via regression is a super-
vised approach that requires labeled data. As we
show in Section 5, this data is available, and the
resulting model generalizes well from relatively
small amounts of training data.

3 Textual Entailment vs. MT Evaluation

Our novel approach to MT evaluation exploits the
similarity between MT evaluation and textual en-
tailment (TE). TE was introduced by Dagan et
al. (2005) as a concept that corresponds more
closely to “common sense” reasoning patterns than
classical, strict logical entailment. Textual entail-
ment is defined informally as a relation between
two natural language sentences (a premise P and
a hypothesis H) that holds if “a human reading P
would infer that H is most likely true”. Knowledge
about entailment is beneficial for NLP tasks such as
Question Answering (Harabagiu and Hickl, 2006).

The relation between textual entailment and MT
evaluation is shown in Figure 1. Perfect MT output
and the reference translation entail each other (top).
Translation problems that impact semantic equiv-
alence, e.g., deletion or addition of material, can
break entailment in one or both directions (bottom).

On the modelling level, there is common ground
between RTE and MT evaluation: Both have to

distinguish between valid and invalid variation to
determine whether two texts convey the same in-
formation or not. For example, to recognize the
bidirectional entailment in Ex. (1), RTE must ac-
count for the following reformulations: synonymy
(However/Nevertheless), more general semantic
relatedness (observers/commentators), phrasal re-
placements (and/as well as), and an active/passive
alternation that implies structural change (is de-
clared/are terming). This leads us to our main hy-
pothesis: RTE features are designed to distinguish
meaning-preserving variation from true divergence
and are thus also good predictors in MT evaluation.
However, while the original RTE task is asymmet-
ric, MT evaluation needs to determine meaning
equivalence, which is a symmetric relation. We do
this by checking for entailment in both directions
(see Figure 1). Operationally, this ensures we detect
translations which either delete or insert material.

Clearly, there are also differences between the
two tasks. An important one is that RTE assumes
the well-formedness of the two sentences. This is
not generally true in MT, and could lead to de-
graded linguistic analyses. However, entailment
relations are more sensitive to the contribution of
individual words (MacCartney and Manning, 2008).
In Example 2, the modal modifiers break the entail-
ment between two otherwise identical sentences:

(2) HYP: Peter is certainly from Lincolnshire.
REF: Peter is possibly from Lincolnshire.

This means that the prediction of TE hinges on
correct semantic analysis and is sensitive to mis-
analyses. In contrast, human MT judgments behave
robustly. Translations that involve individual errors,
like (2), are judged lower than perfect ones, but
usually not crucially so, since most aspects are
still rendered correctly. We thus expect even noisy
RTE features to be predictive for translation quality.
This allows us to use an off-the-shelf RTE system
to obtain features, and to combine them using a
regression model as described in Section 2.

3.1 The Stanford Entailment Recognizer
The Stanford Entailment Recognizer (MacCartney
et al., 2006) is a stochastic model that computes
match and mismatch features for each premise-
hypothesis pair. The three stages of the system
are shown in Figure 2. The system first uses a
robust broad-coverage PCFG parser and a deter-
ministic constituent-dependency converter to con-
struct linguistic representations of the premise and

the hypothesis. The results are typed dependency
graphs that contain a node for each word and la-
beled edges representing the grammatical relations
between words. Named entities are identified, and
contiguous collocations grouped. Next, it identifies
the highest-scoring alignment from each node in
the hypothesis graph to a single node in the premise
graph, or to null. It uses a locally decomposable
scoring function: The score of an alignment is the
sum of the local word and edge alignment scores.
The computation of these scores make extensive
use of about ten lexical similarity resources, in-
cluding WordNet, InfoMap, and Dekang Lin’s the-
saurus. Since the search space is exponential in
the hypothesis length, the system uses stochastic
(rather than exhaustive) search based on Gibbs sam-
pling (see de Marneffe et al. (2007)).

Entailment features. In the third stage, the sys-
tem produces roughly 100 features for each aligned
premise-hypothesis pair. A small number of them
are real-valued (mostly quality scores), but most
are binary implementations of small linguistic the-
ories whose activation indicates syntactic and se-

mantic (mis-)matches of different types. Figure 2
groups the features into five classes. Alignment
features measure the overall quality of the align-
ment as given by the lexical resources. Semantic
compatibility features check to what extent the
aligned material has the same meaning and pre-
serves semantic dimensions such as modality and
factivity, taking a limited amount of context into
account. Insertion/deletion features explicitly ad-
dress material that remains unaligned and assess its
felicity. Reference features ascertain that the two
sentences actually refer to the same events and par-
ticipants. Finally, structural features add structural
considerations by ensuring that argument structure
is preserved in the translation. See MacCartney et
al. (2006) for details on the features, and Sections
5 and 6 for examples of feature firings.

Efficiency considerations. The use of deep lin-
guistic analysis makes our entailment-based met-
ric considerably more heavyweight than traditional
MT metrics. The average total runtime per sentence
pair is 5 seconds on an AMD 2.6GHz Opteron core
– efficient enough to perform regular evaluations on
development and test sets. We are currently investi-
gating caching and optimizations that will enable
the use of our metric for MT parameter tuning in a
Minimum Error Rate Training setup (Och, 2003).

4 Experimental Evaluation

4.1 Experiments

Traditionally, human ratings for MT quality have
been collected in the form of absolute scores on a
five- or seven-point Likert scale, but low reliabil-
ity numbers for this type of annotation have raised
concerns (Callison-Burch et al., 2008). An alter-
native that has been adopted by the yearly WMT
evaluation shared tasks since 2008 is the collection
of pairwise preference judgments between pairs of
MT hypotheses which can be elicited (somewhat)
more reliably. We demonstrate that our approach
works well for both types of annotation and differ-
ent corpora. Experiment 1 models absolute scores
on Asian newswire, and Experiment 2 pairwise
preferences on European speech and news data.

4.2 Evaluation

We evaluate the output of our models both on the
sentence and on the system level. At the sentence
level, we can correlate predictions in Experiment 1
directly with human judgments with Spearman’s ρ ,

299



a non-parametric rank correlation coefficient appro-
priate for non-normally distributed data. In Experi-
ment 2, the predictions cannot be pooled between
sentences. Instead of correlation, we compute “con-
sistency” (i.e., accuracy) with human preferences.

System-level predictions are computed in both
experiments from sentence-level predictions, as the
ratio of sentences for which each system provided
the best translation (Callison-Burch et al., 2008).
We extend this procedure slightly because real-
valued predictions cannot predict ties, while human
raters decide for a significant portion of sentences
(as much as 80% in absolute score annotation) to
“tie” two systems for first place. To simulate this
behavior, we compute “tie-aware” predictions as
the percentage of sentences where the system’s hy-
pothesis was assigned a score better or at most ε
worse than the best system. ε is set to match the
frequency of ties in the training data.

Finally, the predictions are again correlated with
human judgments using Spearman’s ρ . “Tie aware-
ness” makes a considerable practical difference,
improving correlation figures by 5–10 points.1

4.3 Baseline Metrics
We consider four baselines. They are small regres-
sion models as described in Section 2 over com-
ponent scores of four widely used MT metrics. To
alleviate possible nonlinearity, we add all features
in linear and log space. Each baselines carries the
name of the underlying metric plus the suffix -R.2

BLEUR includes the following 18 sentence-level
scores: BLEU-n and n-gram precision scores
(1 ≤ n ≤ 4); BLEU brevity penalty (BP); BLEU
score divided by BP. To counteract BLEU’s brittle-
ness at the sentence level, we also smooth BLEU-n
and n-gram precision as in Lin and Och (2004).

NISTR consists of 16 features. NIST-n scores
(1 ≤ n ≤ 10) and information-weighted n-gram
precision scores (1 ≤ n ≤ 4); NIST brevity penalty
(BP); and NIST score divided by BP.

1Due to space constraints, we only show results for “tie-
aware” predictions. See Padó et al. (2009) for a discussion.

2The regression models can simulate the behaviour of each
component by setting the weights appropriately, but are strictly
more powerful. A possible danger is that the parameters over-
fit on the training set. We therefore verified that the three
non-trivial “baseline” regression models indeed confer a bene-
fit over the default component combination scores: BLEU-1
(which outperformed BLEU-4 in the MetricsMATR 2008 eval-
uation), NIST-4, and TER (with all costs set to 1). We found
higher robustness and improved correlations for the regression
models. An exception is BLEU-1 and NIST-4 on Expt. 1 (Ar,
Ch), which perform 0.5–1 point better at the sentence level.

TERR includes 50 features. We start with the
standard TER score and the number of each of the
four edit operations. Since the default uniform cost
does not always correlate well with human judg-
ment, we duplicate these features for 9 non-uniform
edit costs. We find it effective to set insertion cost
close to 0, as a way of enabling surface variation,
and indeed the new TERp metric uses a similarly
low default insertion cost (Snover et al., 2009).

METEORR consists of METEOR v0.7.

4.4 Combination Metrics

The following three regression models implement
the methods discussed in Sections 2 and 3.

MTR combines the 85 features of the four base-
line models. It uses no entailment features.

RTER uses the 70 entailment features described
in Section 3.1, but no MTR features.

MT+RTER uses all MTR and RTER features,
combining matching and entailment evidence.3

5 Expt. 1: Predicting Absolute Scores

Data. Our first experiment evaluates the models
we have proposed on a corpus with traditional an-
notation on a seven-point scale, namely the NIST
OpenMT 2008 corpus.4 The corpus contains trans-
lations of newswire text into English from three
source languages (Arabic (Ar), Chinese (Ch), Urdu
(Ur)). Each language consists of 1500–2800 sen-
tence pairs produced by 7–15 MT systems.

We use a “round robin” scheme. We optimize
the weights of our regression models on two lan-
guages and then predict the human scores on the
third language. This gauges performance of our
models when training and test data come from the
same genre, but from different languages, which
we believe to be a setup of practical interest. For
each test set, we set the system-level tie parameter
ε so that the relative frequency of ties was equal
to the training set (65–80%). Hypotheses generally
had to receive scores within 0.3−0.5 points to tie.

Results. Table 1 shows the results. We first con-
centrate on the upper half (sentence-level results).
The predictions of all models correlate highly sig-
nificantly with human judgments, but we still see
robustness issues for the individual MT metrics.

METEORR achieves the best correlation for Chi-
nese and Arabic, but fails for Urdu, apparently the
most difficult language. TERR shows the best result
for Urdu, but does worse than METEORR for Ara-
bic and even worse than BLEUR for Chinese. The
MTR combination metric alleviates this problem to
some extent by improving the “worst-case” perfor-
mance on Urdu to the level of the best individual
metric. The entailment-based RTER system outper-
forms MTR on each language. It particularly im-
proves on MTR’s correlation on Urdu. Even though
METEORR still does somewhat better than MTR
and RTER, we consider this an important confirma-
tion for the usefulness of entailment features in MT
evaluation, and for their robustness.5

In addition, the combined model MT+RTER is
best for all three languages, outperforming METE-
ORR for each language pair. It performs consid-
erably better than either MTR or RTER. This is a
second result: the types of evidence provided by
MTR and RTER appear to be complementary and
can be combined into a superior model.

On the system level (bottom half of Table 1),
there is high variance due to the small number of
predictions per language, and many predictions are
not significantly correlated with human judgments.
BLEUR, METEORR, and NISTR significantly pre-
dict one language each (all Arabic); TERR, MTR,
and RTER predict two languages. MT+RTER is
the only model that shows significance for all three
languages. This result supports the conclusions we
have drawn from the sentence-level analysis.

Further analysis. We decided to conduct a thor-
ough analysis of the Urdu dataset, the most difficult
source language for all metrics. We start with a fea-

5These results are substantially better than the performance
our metric showed in the MetricsMATR 2008 challenge. Be-
yond general enhancement of our model, we attribute the less
good MetricsMATR 2008 results to an infelicitous choice
of training data for the submission, coupled with the large
amount of ASR output in the test data, whose disfluencies
represent an additional layer of problems for deep approaches.

ture ablation study. Removing any feature group
from RTER results in drops in correlation of at least
three points. The largest drops occur for the struc-
tural (δ = −11) and insertion/deletion (δ = −8)
features. Thus, all feature groups appear to con-
tribute to the good correlation of RTER. However,
there are big differences in the generality of the
feature groups: in isolation, the insertion/deletion
features achieve almost no correlation, and need to
be complemented by more robust features.

Next, we analyze the role of training data. Fig-
ure 3 shows Urdu average correlations for models
trained on increasing subsets of the training data
(10% increments, 10 random draws per step; Ar
and Ch show similar patterns.) METEORR does not
improve, which is to be expected given the model
definition. RTER has a rather flat learning curve
that climbs to within 2 points of the final correla-
tion value for 20% of the training set (about 400
sentence pairs). Apparently, entailment features do
not require a large training set, presumably because
most features of RTER are binary. The remaining
two models, MTR and MT+RTER, show clearer
benefit from more data. With 20% of the total data,
they climb to within 5 points of their final perfor-
mance, but keep slowly improving further.

Table 2: Expt. 1: Reference translations and MT output (Urdu). Scores are out of 7 (higher is better).

Finally, we provide a qualitative comparison of
RTER’s performance against the best baseline met-
ric, METEORR. Since the computation of RTER
takes considerably more resources than METEORR,
it is interesting to compare the predictions of RTER
against METEORR. Table 2 shows two classes of
examples with apparent improvements.

The first example (top) shows a good translation
that is erroneously assigned a low score by ME-
TEORR because (a) it cannot align fact and reality
(METEORR aligns only synonyms) and (b) it pun-
ishes the change of word order through its “penalty”
term. RTER correctly assigns a high score. The
features show that this prediction results from two
semantic judgments. The first is that the lack of
alignments for two function words is unproblem-
atic; the second is that the alignment between fact
and reality, which is established on the basis of
WordNet similarity, is indeed licensed in the cur-
rent context. More generally, we find that RTER
is able to account for more valid variation in good
translations because (a) it judges the validity of
alignments dependent on context; (b) it incorpo-
rates more semantic similarities; and (c) it weighs
mismatches according to the word’s status.

The second example (bottom) shows a very bad
translation that is scored highly by METEORR,
since almost all of the reference words appear either
literally or as synonyms in the hypothesis (marked
in italics). In combination with METEORR’s con-
centration on recall, this is sufficient to yield a
moderately high score. In the case of RTER, a num-
ber of mismatch features have fired. They indicate
problems with the structural well-formedness of
the MT output as well as semantic incompatibil-
ity between hypothesis and reference (argument
structure and reference mismatches).

6 Expt. 2: Predicting Pairwise Preferences

In this experiment, we predict human pairwise pref-
erence judgments (cf. Section 4). We reuse the
linear regression framework from Section 2 and
predict pairwise preferences by predicting two ab-
solute scores (as before) and comparing them.6

Data. This experiment uses the 2006–2008 cor-
pora of the Workshop on Statistical Machine
Translation (WMT).7 It consists of data from EU-
ROPARL (Koehn, 2005) and various news com-
mentaries, with five source languages (French, Ger-
man, Spanish, Czech, and Hungarian). As training
set, we use the portions of WMT 2006 and 2007
that are annotated with absolute scores on a five-
point scale (around 14,000 sentences produced by
40 systems). The test set is formed by the WMT
2008 relative rank annotation task. As in Experi-
ment 1, we set ε so that the incidence of ties in the
training and test set is equal (60%).

Results. Table 4 shows the results. The left result
column shows consistency, i.e., the accuracy on
human pairwise preference judgments.8 The pat-
tern of results matches our observations in Expt. 1:
Among individual metrics, METEORR and TERR
do better than BLEUR and NISTR. MTR and RTER
outperform individual metrics. The best result by a
wide margin, 52.5%, is shown by MT+RTER.

6We also experimented with a logistic regression model
that predicts binary preferences directly. Its performance is
comparable; see Padó et al. (2009) for details.

7Available from http://www.statmt.org/.
8The random baseline is not 50%, but, according to our

experiments, 39.8%. This has two reasons: (1) the judgments
include contradictory and tie annotations that cannot be pre-
dicted correctly (raw inter-annotator agreement on WMT 2008
was 58%); (2) metrics have to submit a total order over the
translations for each sentence, which introduces transitivity
constraints. For details, see Callison-Burch et al. (2008).

TERR than for BLEUR and NISTR, and the indi-
vidual metrics do worse than the combination mod-
els. Among the latter, the order is: MTR (worst),
MT+RTER, and RTER (best at 78.3).

WMT 2009. We submitted the Expt. 2 RTER
metric to the WMT 2009 shared MT evaluation
task (Padó et al., 2009). The results provide fur-
ther validation for our results and our general ap-
proach. At the system level, RTER made third place
(avg. correlation ρ = 0.79), trailing the two top met-
rics closely (ρ = 0.80, ρ = 0.83) and making the
best predictions for Hungarian. It also obtained the
second-best consistency score (53%, best: 54%).

Metric comparison. The pairwise preference an-
notation of WMT 2008 gives us the opportunity to
compare the MTR and RTER models by comput-
ing consistency separately on the “top” (highest-
ranked) and “bottom” (lowest-ranked) hypotheses

for each reference. RTER performs about 1.5 per-
cent better on the top than on the bottom hypothe-
ses. The MTR model shows the inverse behavior,
performing 2 percent worse on the top hypothe-
ses. This matches well with our intuitions: We see
some noise-induced degradation for the entailment
features, but not much. In contrast, surface-based
features are better at detecting bad translations than
at discriminating among good ones.

Table 3 further illustrates the difference between
the top models on two example sentences. In the top
example, RTER makes a more accurate prediction
than MTR. The human rater’s favorite translation
deviates considerably from the reference in lexi-
cal choice, syntactic structure, and word order, for
which it is punished by MTR (rank 3/5). In contrast,
RTER determines correctly that the propositional
content of the reference is almost completely pre-
served (rank 1). In the bottom example, RTER’s
prediction is less accurate. This sentence was rated
as bad by the judge, presumably due to the inap-
propriate main verb translation. Together with the
subject mismatch, MTR correctly predicts a low
score (rank 5/5). RTER’s attention to semantic over-
lap leads to an incorrect high score (rank 2/5).

Feature Weights. Finally, we make two observa-
tions about feature weights in the RTER model.

First, the model has learned high weights not
only for the overall alignment score (which be-
haves most similarly to traditional metrics), but also
for a number of binary syntacto-semantic match
and mismatch features. This confirms that these
features systematically confer the benefit we have
shown anecdotally in Table 2. Features with a con-
sistently negative effect include dropping adjuncts,
unaligned or poorly aligned root nodes, incompat-
ible modality between the main clauses, person
and location mismatches (as opposed to general
mismatches) and wrongly handled passives. Con-

versely, higher scores result from factors such as
high alignment score, matching embeddings under
factive verbs, and matches between appositions.

Second, good MT evaluation feature weights are
not good weights for RTE. Some differences, par-
ticularly for structural features, are caused by the
low grammaticality of MT data. For example, the
feature that fires for mismatches between depen-
dents of predicates is unreliable on the WMT data.
Other differences do reflect more fundamental dif-
ferences between the two tasks (cf. Section 3). For
example, RTE puts high weights onto quantifier
and polarity features, both of which have the poten-
tial of influencing entailment decisions, but are (at
least currently) unimportant for MT evaluation.

7 Related Work

Researchers have exploited various resources to en-
able the matching between words or n-grams that
are semantically close but not identical. Banerjee
and Lavie (2005) and Chan and Ng (2008) use
WordNet, and Zhou et al. (2006) and Kauchak
and Barzilay (2006) exploit large collections of
automatically-extracted paraphrases. These ap-
proaches reduce the risk that a good translation
is rated poorly due to lexical deviation, but do not
address the problem that a translation may contain
many long matches while lacking coherence and
grammaticality (cf. the bottom example in Table 2).

Thus, incorporation of syntactic knowledge has
been the focus of another line of research. Amigó
et al. (2006) use the degree of overlap between the
dependency trees of reference and hypothesis as a
predictor of translation quality. Similar ideas have
been applied by Owczarzak et al. (2008) to LFG
parses, and by Liu and Gildea (2005) to features
derived from phrase-structure tress. This approach
has also been successful for the related task of
summarization evaluation (Hovy et al., 2006).

The most comparable work to ours is Giménez
and Márquez (2008). Our results agree on the cru-
cial point that the use of a wide range of linguistic
knowledge in MT evaluation is desirable and im-
portant. However, Giménez and Márquez advocate
the use of a bottom-up development process that
builds on a set of “heterogeneous”, independent
metrics each of which measures overlap with re-
spect to one linguistic level. In contrast, our aim
is to provide a “top-down”, integrated motivation
for the features we integrate through the textual
entailment recognition paradigm.

8 Conclusion and Outlook

In this paper, we have explored a strategy for the
evaluation of MT output that aims at comprehen-
sively assessing the meaning equivalence between
reference and hypothesis. To do so, we exploit the
common ground between MT evaluation and the
Recognition of Textual Entailment (RTE), both of
which have to distinguish valid from invalid lin-
guistic variation. Conceputalizing MT evaluation
as an entailment problem motivates the use of a
rich feature set that covers, unlike almost all earlier
metrics, a wide range of linguistic levels, including
lexical, syntactic, and compositional phenomena.

We have used an off-the-shelf RTE system to
compute these features, and demonstrated that a
regression model over these features can outper-
form an ensemble of traditional MT metrics in two
experiments on different datasets. Even though the
features build on deep linguistic analysis, they are
robust enough to be used in a real-world setting, at
least on written text. A limited amount of training
data is sufficient, and the weights generalize well.

Our data analysis has confirmed that each of the
feature groups contributes to the overall success of
the RTE metric, and that its gains come from its
better success at abstracting away from valid vari-
ation (such as word order or lexical substitution),
while still detecting major semantic divergences.
We have also clarified the relationship between MT
evaluation and textual entailment: The majority of
phenomena (but not all) that are relevant for RTE
are also informative for MT evaluation.

The focus of this study was on the use of an ex-
isting RTE infrastructure for MT evaluation. Future
work will have to assess the effectiveness of individ-
ual features and investigate ways to customize RTE
systems for the MT evaluation task. An interesting
aspect that we could not follow up on in this paper
is that entailment features are linguistically inter-
pretable (cf. Fig. 2) and may find use in uncovering
systematic shortcomings of MT systems.

A limitation of our current metric is that it is
language-dependent and relies on NLP tools in
the target language that are still unavailable for
many languages, such as reliable parsers. To some
extent, of course, this problem holds as well for
state-of-the-art MT systems. Nevertheless, it must
be an important focus of future research to develop
robust meaning-based metrics for other languages
that can cash in the promise that we have shown
for evaluating translation into English.
