Abstract

This paper presents a set of Bayesian
methods for automatically extending the
WORDNET ontology with new concepts
and annotating existing concepts with
generic property fields, or attributes. We
base our approach on Latent Dirichlet Al-
location and evaluate along two dimen-
sions: (1) the precision of the ranked
lists of attributes, and (2) the quality of
the attribute assignments to WORDNET
concepts. In all cases we find that the
principled LDA-based approaches outper-
form previously proposed heuristic meth-
ods, greatly improving the specificity of
attributes at each concept.

1 Introduction

We present a Bayesian approach for simultane-
ously extending Is-A hierarchies such as those
found in WORDNET (WN) (Fellbaum, 1998) with
additional concepts, and annotating the resulting
concept graph with attributes, i.e., generic prop-
erty fields shared by instances of that concept. Ex-
amples of attributes include “height” and “eye-
color” for the concept Person or “gdp” and “pres-
ident” for Country. Identifying and extracting
such attributes relative to a set of flat (i.e., non-
hierarchically organized) labeled classes of in-
stances has been extensively studied, using a vari-
ety of data, e.g., Web search query logs (Paşca and
Van Durme, 2008), Web documents (Yoshinaga
and Torisawa, 2007), and Wikipedia (Suchanek et
al., 2007; Wu and Weld, 2008).

Building on the current state of the art in at-
tribute extraction, we propose a model-based ap-
proach for mapping flat sets of attributes anno-
tated with class labels into an existing ontology.
This inference problem is divided into two main
components: (1) identifying the appropriate par-
ent concept for each labeled class and (2) learning

the correct level of abstraction for each attribute in
the extended ontology. For example, consider the
task of annotating WN with the labeled class re-
naissance painters containing the class instances
Pisanello, Hieronymus Bosch, and Jan van Eyck
and associated with the attributes “famous works”
and “style.” Since there is no WN concept for
renaissance painters, the latter would need to be
mapped into WN under, e.g., Painter. Further-
more, since “famous works” and “style” are not
specific to renaissance painters (or even the WN
concept Painter), they should be placed at the
most appropriate level of abstraction, e.g., Artist.
In this paper, we show that both of these goals
can be realized jointly using a probabilistic topic
model, namely hierarchical Latent Dirichlet Allo-
cation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003b).

There are three main advantages to using a topic
model as the annotation procedure: (1) Unlike hi-
erarchical clustering (Duda et al., 2000), the at-
tribute distribution at a concept node is not com-
posed of the distributions of its children; attributes
found specific to the concept Painter would not
need to appear in the distribution of attributes for
Person, making the internal distributions at each
concept more meaningful as attributes specific to
that concept; (2) Since LDA is fully Bayesian, its
model semantics allow additional prior informa-
tion to be included, unlike standard models such as
Latent Semantic Analysis (Hofmann, 1999), im-
proving annotation precision; (3) Attributes with
multiple related meanings (i.e., polysemous at-
tributes) are modeled implicitly: if an attribute
(e.g., “style”) occurs in two separate input classes
(e.g., poets and car models), then that attribute
might attach at two different concepts in the ontol-
ogy, which is better than attaching it at their most
specific common ancestor (Whole) if that ancestor
is too general to be useful. However, there is also
a pressure for these two occurrences to attach to a
single concept.

We use WORDNET 3.0 as the specific test on-
tology for our annotation procedure, and evalu-

ate three variants: (1) a fixed structure approach
where each flat class is attached to WN using
a simple string-matching heuristic, and concept
nodes are annotated using LDA, (2) an extension
of LDA allowing for sense selection in addition to
annotation, and (3) an approach employing a non-
parametric prior over tree structures capable of in-
ferring arbitrary ontologies.

framework, §3 introduces the LDA-based topic

2 Ontology Annotation

Input to our ontology annotation procedure con-
sists of sets of class instances (e.g., Pisanello,
Hieronymus Bosch) associated with class labels
(e.g., renaissance painters) and attributes (e.g.,
“birthplace”, “famous works”, “style” and “early
life”). Clusters of noun phrases (instances) are
constructed using distributional similarity (Lin
and Pantel, 2002; Hearst, 1992) and are labeled
by applying “such-as” surface patterns to raw Web
text (e.g., “renaissance painters such as Hierony-
mous Bosch”), yielding 870K instances in more
than 4500 classes (Paşca and Van Durme, 2008).

Attributes for each flat labeled class are ex-
tracted from anonymized Web search query
logs using the minimally supervised procedure
in (Paşca, 2008)1. Candidate attributes are ranked
based on their weighted Jaccard similarity to a
set of 5 manually provided seed attributes for the

class european countries. Figure 1 illustrates sev-
eral such labeled attribute sets (the underlying in-
stances are not depicted). Naturally, the attributes
extracted are not perfect, e.g., “lb” and “renault
connexions” as attributes for london boroughs.

We propose a set of Bayesian generative models
based on LDA that take as input labeled attribute
sets generated using an extraction procedure such
as the above and organize the attributes in WN ac-
cording to their level of generality. Annotating
WN with attributes proceeds in three steps: (1)
attaching labeled attribute sets to leaf concepts in
WN using string distance, (2) inferring an attribute
model using one of the LDA variants discussed in
§ 3, and (3) generating ranked lists of attributes for
each concept using the model probabilities (§ 4.3).

3 Hierarchical Topic Models

3.1 Latent Dirichlet Allocation
The underlying mechanism for our annotation
procedure is LDA (Blei et al., 2003b), a fully
Bayesian extension of probabilistic Latent Seman-
tic Analysis (Hofmann, 1999). Given D labeled
attribute sets wd, d ∈ D, LDA infers an unstruc-
tured set of T latent annotated concepts over
which attribute sets decompose as mixtures.2 The
latent annotated concepts represent semantically
coherent groups of attributes expressed in the data,
as shown in Example 1.

The generative model for LDA is given by

θd|α ∼ Dir(α), d ∈ 1 . . . D
βt|η ∼ Dir(η), t ∈ 1 . . . T
zi,d|θd ∼ Mult(θd), i ∈ 1 . . . |wd|
wi,d|βzi,d ∼ Mult(βzi,d), i ∈ 1 . . . |wd|

(1)
where α and η are hyperparameters smoothing
the per-attribute set distribution over concepts and
per-concept attribute distribution respectively (see
Figure 2 for the graphical model). We are inter-
ested in the case where w is known and we want

tribute sets are documents.

to compute the conditional posterior of the remain-
ing random variables p(z,β,θ|w). This distribu-
tion can be approximated efficiently using Gibbs
sampling. See (Blei et al., 2003b) and (Griffiths
and Steyvers, 2002) for more details.

(Example 1) Given 26 labeled attribute sets falling into
three broad semantic categories: philosophers, writers
and actors (e.g., sets for contemporary philosophers,
women writers, bollywood actors), LDA is able to infer
a meaningful set of latent annotated concepts:

quotations
teachings

virtue ethics
philosophies

biography
sayings

new movies
filmography

official website
biography

email address
autobiography

writing style
influences

achievements
bibliography
family tree

short biography

(philosopher) (writer) (actor)

(concept labels manually added for the latent annotated
concepts are shown in parentheses). Note that with a flat
concept structure, attributes can only be separated into
broad clusters, so the generality/specificity of attributes
cannot be inferred. Parameters were α=1, η=0.1, T=3.

3.2 Fixed-Structure LDA
In this paper, we extend LDA to model structural
dependencies between latent annotated concepts
(cf. (Li and McCallum, 2006; Sivic et al., 2008));
In particular, we fix the concept structure to cor-
respond to the WN Is-A hierarchy. Each labeled
attribute set is assigned to a leaf concept in WN
based on the edit distance between the concept la-
bel and the attribute set label. Possible latent con-
cepts for this set include the concepts along all
paths from its attachment point to the WN root,
following Is-A relation edges. Therefore, any two
labeled attribute sets share a number of latent con-
cepts based on their similarity in WN: all labeled
attribute sets share at least the root concept, and
may share more concepts depending on their most
specific, common ancestor. Under such a model,
more general attributes naturally attach to latent
concept nodes closer to the root, and more specific
attributes attach lower (Example 2).

Formally, we introduce into LDA an extra set of
random variables cd identifying the subset of con-
cepts in T available to attribute set d, as shown
in the diagram at the middle of Figure 2.3 For
example, with a tree structure, cd would be con-
strained to correspond to the concept nodes in T
on the path from the root to the leaf containing d.
Equation 1 can be adapted to this case if the in-
dex t is taken to range over concepts applicable to
attribute set d.

3Abusing notation, we use T to refer to a structured set of
concepts and to refer to the number of concepts in flat LDA

(Example 2 ) Fixing the latent concept structure to cor-
respond to WN (dark/purple nodes), and attaching each
labeled attribute set (examples depicted by light/orange
nodes) yields the annotated hierarchy:

works
picture
writings
history

biography

philosophy
natural rights

criticism
ethics
law

literary criticism
books
essays

short stories

filmography
biographies

philosopher writer actor

scholar

intellectual

performer

entertainerliterate

communicator

bollywood
actors

women
writers

contemporary 
philosophers

Attribute distributions for the small nodes are not shown.
Dotted lines indicate multiple paths from the root, which
can be inferred using sense selection. Unlike with the flat
annotated concept structure, with a hierarchical concept
structure, attributes can be separated by their generality.
Parameters were set at α=1 and η=0.1.

3.3 Sense-Selective LDA
For each labeled attribute set, determining the ap-
propriate parent concept in WN is difficult since a
single class label may be found in many different
synsets (for example, the class bollywood actors
might attach to the “thespian” sense of Actor or
the “doer” sense). Fixed-hierarchy LDA can be
extended to perform automatic sense selection by
placing a distribution over the leaf concepts c, de-
scribing the prior probability of each possible path
through the concept tree. For WN, this amounts
to fixing the set of concepts to which a labeled at-
tribute set can attach (e.g., restricting it to a seman-
tically similar subset) and assigning a probability
to each concept (e.g., using the relative WN con-
cept frequencies). The probability for each sense
attachment cd becomes

p(cd|w, c−d, z) ∝ p(wd|c,w−d, z)p(cd|c−d),

i.e., the complete conditionals for sense selection.
p(cd|c−d) is the conditional probability for attach-
ing attribute set d at cd (e.g., simply the prior
p(cd|c−d)

def
= p(cd) in the WN case). A closed

form expression for p(wd|c,w−d, z) is derived
in (Blei et al., 2003a).

3.4 Nested Chinese Restaurant Process
In the final model, shown in the diagram on the
right side of Figure 2, LDA is extended hierarchi-
cally to infer arbitrary fixed-depth tree structures

from data. Unlike the fixed-structure and sense-
selective approaches which use the WN hierarchy
directly, the nCRP generates its own annotated hi-
erarchy whose concept nodes do not necessarily
correspond to WN concepts (Example 3). Each
node in the tree instead corresponds to a latent an-
notated concept with an arbitrary number of sub-
concepts, distributed according to a Dirichlet Pro-
cess (Ferguson, 1973). Due to its recursive struc-
ture, the underlying model is called the nested Chi-
nese Restaurant Process (nCRP). The model in
Equation 1 is extended with cd|γ ∼ nCRP(γ, L),
d ∈ D i.e., latent concepts for each attribute set are
drawn from an nCRP. The hyperparameter γ con-
trols the probability of branching via the per-node
Dirichlet Process, and L is the fixed tree depth.
An efficient Gibbs sampling procedure is given
in (Blei et al., 2003a).

(Example 3) Applying nCRP to the same three semantic
categories: philosophers, writers and actors, yields the
model:

biography
date of birth
childhood

picture
family

works
books

quotations
critics
poems

teachings
virtue ethics
structuralism
philosophies 

political theory

philosophers

(manually added labels are shown in parentheses). Un-
like in WN, the inferred structure naturally places
philosopher and writer under the same subconcept,
which is also separate from actor. Hyperparameters were
α=0.1, η=0.1, γ=1.0.

4 Experimental Setup
4.1 Data Analysis

We employ two data sets derived using the pro-
cedure in (Paşca and Van Durme, 2008): the full
set of automatic extractions generated in § 2, and a
subset consisting of all attribute sets that fall under
the hierarchies rooted at the WN concepts living
thing#1 (i.e., the first sense of living thing), sub-
stance#7, location#1, person#1, organization#1
and food#1, manually selected to cover a high-
precision subset of labeled attribute sets. By com-
paring the results across the two datasets we can

measure each model’s robustness to noise.
In the full dataset, there are 4502 input attribute

sets with a total of 225K attributes (24K unique),
of which 8121 occur only once. The 10 attributes
occurring in the most sets (history, definition, pic-
ture(s), images, photos, clipart, timeline, clip art,
types) account for 6% of the total. For the subset,
there are 1510 attribute sets with 76K attributes
(11K unique), of which 4479 occur only once.

4.2 Model Settings

Baseline: Each labeled attribute set is mapped to
the most common WN concept with the closest la-
bel string distance (Paşca, 2008). Attributes are
propagated up the tree, attaching to node c if they
are contained in a majority of c’s children.

LDA: LDA is used to infer a flat set of T = 300
latent annotated concepts describing the data. The
concept selection smoothing parameter is set as
α=100. The smoother for the per-concept multi-
nomial over words is set as η=0.1.4 The effects of
concept structure on attribute precision can be iso-
lated by comparing the structured models to LDA.

Fixed-Structure LDA (fsLDA): The latent con-
cept hierarchy is fixed based on WN (§ 3.2), and
labeled attribute sets are mapped into it as in base-
line. The concept graph for each labeled attribute
set wd is decomposed into (possibly overlapping)
chains, one for each unique path from the WN root
to wd’s attachment point. Each path is assigned a
copy wd, reducing the bias in attribute sets with
many unique ancestor concepts.5 The final mod-
els contain 6566 annotated concepts on average.

Sense-Selective LDA (ssLDA): For the sense se-
lective approach (§ 3.3), the set of possible sense
attachments for each attribute set is taken to be all
WN concepts with the lowest edit distance to its
label, and the conditional probability of each sense
attachment p(cd) is set proportional to its relative
frequency. This procedure results in 2 to 3 senses
per attribute set on average, yielding models with
7108 annotated concepts.

Arbitrary hierarchy (nCRP): For the arbitrary
hierarchy model (§ 3.4), we set the maximum
tree depth L=5, per-concept attribute smoother
η=0.05, concept assignment smoother α=10 and
nCRP branching proportion γ=1.0. The resulting

4(Parameter setting) Across all models, the main results
in this paper are robust to changes in α. For nCRP, changes
in η and γ affect the size of the learned model but have less
effect on the final precision. Larger values for L give the
model more flexibility, but take longer to train.

5Reducing the directed-acyclic graph to a tree ontology
did not significantly affect precision.

models span 380 annotated concepts on average.

4.3 Constructing Ranked Lists of Attributes
Given an inferred model, there are several ways to
construct ranked lists of attributes:

Per-Node Distribution: In fsLDA and ssLDA,
attribute rankings can be constructed directly for
each WN concept c, by computing the likelihood
of attribute w attaching to c, L(c|w) = p(w|c) av-
eraged over all Gibbs samples (discarding a fixed
number of samples for burn-in). Since c’s attribute
distribution is not dependent on the distributions
of its children, the resulting distribution is biased
towards more specific attributes.

Class-Entropy (CE): In all models, the inferred
latent annotated concepts can be used to smooth
the attribute rankings for each labeled attribute set.
Each sample from the posterior is composed of
two components: (1) a multinomial distribution
over a set of WN nodes, p(c|wd, α) for each at-
tribute set wd, where the (discrete) values of c are
WN concepts, and (2) a multinomial distribution
over attributes p(w|c, η) for each WN concept c.
To compute an attribute ranking for wd, we have

p(w|wd) =
∑

c

p(w|c, η)p(c|wd, α).

Given this new ranking for each attribute set, we
can compute new rankings for each WN concept
c by averaging again over all the wd that appear
as (possible indirect) descendants of c. Thus, this
method uses LDA to first perform reranking on the
raw extractions before applying the baseline ontol-
ogy induction procedure (§ 4.2).6

CE ranking exhibits a “conservation of entropy”
effect, whereby the proportion of general to spe-
cific attributes in each attribute set wd remains the
same in the posterior. If set A contains 10 specific
attributes and 30 generic ones, then the latter will
be favored over the former in the resulting distri-
bution 3 to 1. Conservation of entropy is a strong
assumption, and in particular it hinders improving
the specificity of attribute rankings.

Class-Entropy+Prior: The LDA-based models
do not inherently make use of any ranking infor-
mation contained in the original extractions. How-
ever, such information can be incorporated in the
form of a prior. The final ranking method com-
bines CE with an exponential prior over the at-
tribute rank in the baseline extraction. For each
attribute set, we compute the probability of each

6One simple extension is to run LDA again on the CE
ranked output, yielding an iterative procedure; however, this
was not found to significantly affect precision.

attribute p(w|wd) = plda(w|wd)pbase(w|wd), as-
suming a parametric form for pbase(w|wd)

def
=

θr(w,wd). Here, r(w,wd) is the rank of w in at-
tribute set d. In all experiments reported, θ=0.9.

4.4 Evaluating Attribute Attachment
For the WN-based models, in addition to mea-
suring the average precision of the reranked at-
tributes, it is also useful to evaluate the assign-
ment of attributes to WN concepts. For this eval-
uation, human annotators were asked to determine
the most appropriate WN synset(s) for a set of gold
attributes, taking into account polysemous usage.
For each model, ranked lists of possible concept
assignments C(w) are generated for each attribute
w, usingL(c|w) for ranking. The accuracy of a list
C(w) for an attribute w is measured by a scoring
metric that corresponds to a modification (Paşca
and Alfonseca, 2009) of the mean reciprocal rank
score (Voorhees and Tice, 2000):

DRR = max
1

rank(c)× (1 + PathToGold)

where rank(c) is the rank (from 1 up to 10) of a
concept c in C(w), and PathToGold is the length
of the minimum path along Is-A edges in the con-
ceptual hierarchies between the concept c, on one
hand, and any of the gold-standard concepts man-
ually identified for the attribute w, on the other
hand. The length PathToGold is 0, if the returned
concept is the same as the gold-standard concept.
Conversely, a gold-standard attribute receives no
credit (that is, DRR is 0) if no path is found in
the hierarchies between the top 10 concepts of
C(w) and any of the gold-standard concepts, or if
C(w) is empty. The overalll precision of a given
model is the average of the DRR scores of individ-
ual attributes, computed over the gold assignment
set (Paşca and Alfonseca, 2009).

5 Results

5.1 Attribute Precision
Precision was manually evaluated relative to 23
concepts chosen for broad coverage.7 Table 1
shows precision at n and the Mean Average Preci-
sion (MAP); In all LDA-based models, the Bayes
average posterior is taken over all Gibbs samples

7(Precision evaluation) Attributes were hand annotated
using the procedure in (Paşca and Van Durme, 2008) and nu-
merical precision scores (1.0 for vital, 0.5 for okay and 0.0 for
incorrect) were assigned for the top 50 attributes per concept.
25 reference concepts were originally chosen, but 2 were not
populated with attributes in any method, and hence were ex-
cluded from the comparison.

timate and for ssLDA there was a 26% reduction.

over the baseline, fsLDA yields a 31% reduction,
ssLDA yields a 33% reduction and nCRP yields
a 48% reduction (24% reduction over fsLDA).
Performance also improves relative to the ranked
baseline when prior ranking information is incor-
porated in the LDA-based models, as indicated
by CE+Prior scores in Table 1. LDA and fsLDA
reduce relative error by 6%, ssLDA by 9% and
nCRP by 33%. Furthermore, nCRP precision
without ranking information surpasses the base-
line with ranking information, indicating robust-
ness to extraction noise. Precision curves for indi-
vidual attribute sets are shown in Figure 3. Over-
all, learning unconstrained hierarchies (nCRP) in-
creases precision, but as the inferred node distri-
butions do not correspond to WN concepts they
cannot be used for annotation.

One benefit to using an admixture model like
LDA is that each concept node in the resulting
model contains a distribution over attributes spe-
cific only to that node (in contrast to, e.g., hierar-
chical agglomerative clustering). Although abso-
lute precision is lower as more general attributes
have higher average precision (Per-Node scores
in Table 1), these distributions are semantically
meaningful in many cases (Figure 4) and further-
more can be used to calculate concept assignment
precision for each attribute.9

sets. Ranked lists of attributes are generated using the CE+Prior method.

5.2 Concept Assignment Precision
The precision of assigning attributes to various
concepts is summarized in Table 2. Two scores are
given: all measures DRR relative to the entire gold
assignment set, and found measures DRR only for
attributes with DRR(w)>0. Comparing the scores
gives an estimate of whether coverage or precision
is responsible for differences in scores. fsLDA and
ssLDA both yield a 20% reduction in relative er-
ror (17.2% increase in absolute DRR) over the un-
ranked baseline and a 17.2% reduction (14.2% ab-
solute increase) over the ranked baseline.

5.3 Subset Precision and DRR
Precision scores for the manually selected subset
of extractions are given in the second half of Ta-
ble 1. Relative to the unranked baseline, fsLDA
and nCRP yield 42% and 44% reductions in er-
ror respectively, and relative to the ranked base-
line they both yield a 21.4% reduction. In terms of
absolute precision, there is no benefit to adding in
prior ranking knowledge to fsLDA or nCRP, in-
dicating diminishing returns as average baseline
precision increases (Baseline vs. fsLDA/nCRP CE
scores). Broken down across each of the subhier-
archies, LDA helps in all cases except food.

DRR scores for the subset are given in the lower
half of Table 2. Averaged over all gold test at-
tributes, DRR scores double when using fsLDA.
These results can be misleading, however, due
to artificially low coverage. Hence, Table 2 also
shows DRR scores broken down over each sub-
hierarchy, In this case fsLDA more than doubles
the DRR relative to the baseline for substance and
location, and triples it for organization and food.

ated for LDA or nCRP, because they are not mapped to WN.

6 Related Work

A large body of previous work exists on extend-
ing WORDNET with additional concepts and in-
stances (Snow et al., 2006; Suchanek et al., 2007);
these methods do not address attributes directly.
Previous literature in attribute extraction takes ad-
vantage of a range of data sources and extraction
procedures (Chklovski and Gil, 2005; Tokunaga
et al., 2005; Paşca and Van Durme, 2008; Yoshi-
naga and Torisawa, 2007; Probst et al., 2007; Van
Durme et al., 2008; Wu and Weld, 2008). How-
ever these methods do not address the task of de-
termining the level of specificity for each attribute.
The closest studies to ours are (Paşca, 2008), im-
plemented as the baseline method in this paper;
and (Paşca and Alfonseca, 2009), which relies on
heuristics rather than formal models to estimate
the specificity of each attribute.

7 Conclusion

This paper introduced a set of methods based on
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for jointly ex-
tending the WORDNET ontology and annotating
its concepts with attributes (see Figure 4 for the
end result). LDA significantly outperformed a pre-
vious approach both in terms of the concept as-
signment precision (i.e., determining the correct
level of generality for an attribute) and the mean-
average precision of attribute lists at each concept
(i.e., filtering out noisy attributes from the base ex-
traction set). Also, relative precision of the attach-
ment models was shown to improve significantly
when the raw extraction quality increased, show-
ing the long-term viability of the approach.

Figure 4: Example per-node attribute distribution generated by fsLDA. Light/orange nodes represent
labeled attribute sets attached to WN, and the full hypernym graph is given for each in dark/purple
nodes. White nodes depict the top attributes predicted for each WN concept. These inferred annotations
exhibit a high degree of concept specificity, naturally becoming more general at higher levels of the
ontology. Some annotations, such as for the concepts Agent, Substance, Living Thing and Person have
high precision and specificity while others, such as Liquor and Actor need improvement. Overall, the
more general concepts yield better annotations as they are averaged over many labeled attribute sets,
reducing noise. 627
