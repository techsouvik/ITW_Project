Abstract

We present a series of experiments on au-
tomatically identifying the sense of im-
plicit discourse relations, i.e. relations
that are not marked with a discourse con-
nective such as “but” or “because”. We
work with a corpus of implicit relations
present in newspaper text and report re-
sults on a test set that is representative
of the naturally occurring distribution of
senses. We use several linguistically in-
formed features, including polarity tags,
Levin verb classes, length of verb phrases,
modality, context, and lexical features. In
addition, we revisit past approaches using
lexical pairs from unannotated text as fea-
tures, explain some of their shortcomings
and propose modifications. Our best com-
bination of features outperforms the base-
line from data intensive approaches by 4%
for comparison and 16% for contingency.

1 Introduction

Implicit discourse relations abound in text and
readers easily recover the sense of such relations
during semantic interpretation. But automatic
sense prediction for implicit relations is an out-
standing challenge in discourse processing.

Discourse relations, such as causal and contrast
relations, are often marked by explicit discourse
connectives (also called cue words) such as “be-
cause” or “but”. It is not uncommon, though, for a
discourse relation to hold between two text spans
without an explicit discourse connective, as the ex-
ample below demonstrates:

(1) The 101-year-old magazine has never had to woo ad-
vertisers with quite so much fervor before.

[because] It largely rested on its hard-to-fault demo-
graphics.

In this paper we address the problem of au-
tomatic sense prediction for discourse relations

in newspaper text. For our experiments, we use
the Penn Discourse Treebank, the largest exist-
ing corpus of discourse annotations for both im-
plicit and explicit relations. Our work is also
informed by the long tradition of data intensive
methods that rely on huge amounts of unanno-
tated text rather than on manually tagged corpora
(Marcu and Echihabi, 2001; Blair-Goldensohn et
al., 2007).

In our analysis, we focus only on implicit dis-
course relations and clearly separate these from
explicits. Explicit relations are easy to iden-
tify. The most general senses (comparison, con-
tingency, temporal and expansion) can be disam-
biguated in explicit relations with 93% accuracy
based solely on the discourse connective used to
signal the relation (Pitler et al., 2008). So report-
ing results on explicit and implicit relations sepa-
rately will allow for clearer tracking of progress.

In this paper we investigate the effectiveness of
various features designed to capture lexical and
semantic regularities for identifying the sense of
implicit relations. Given two text spans, previous
work has used the cross-product of the words in
the spans as features. We examine the most infor-
mative word pair features and find that they are not
the semantically-related pairs that researchers had
hoped. We then introduce several other methods
capturing the semantics of the spans (polarity fea-
tures, semantic classes, tense, etc.) and evaluate
their effectiveness. This is the first study which
reports results on classifying naturally occurring
implicit relations in text and uses the natural dis-
tribution of the various senses.

2 Related Work

Experiments on implicit and explicit relations
Previous work has dealt with the prediction of dis-
course relation sense, but often for explicits and at
the sentence level.

Soricut and Marcu (2003) address the task of

683



parsing discourse structures within the same sen-
tence. They use the RST corpus (Carlson et al.,
2001), which contains 385 Wall Street Journal ar-
ticles annotated following the Rhetorical Structure
Theory (Mann and Thompson, 1988). Many of
the useful features, syntax in particular, exploit
the fact that both arguments of the connective are
found in the same sentence. Such features would
not be applicable to the analysis of implicit rela-
tions that occur intersententially.

Wellner et al. (2006) used the GraphBank (Wolf
and Gibson, 2005), which contains 105 Associated
Press and 30 Wall Street Journal articles annotated
with discourse relations. They achieve 81% accu-
racy in sense disambiguation on this corpus. How-
ever, GraphBank annotations do not differentiate
between implicits and explicits, so it is difficult to
verify success for implicit relations.

Experiments on artificial implicits Marcu and
Echihabi (2001) proposed a method for cheap ac-
quisition of training data for discourse relation
sense prediction. Their idea is to use unambiguous
patterns such as [Arg1, but Arg2.] to create syn-
thetic examples of implicit relations. They delete
the connective and use [Arg1, Arg2] as an example
of an implicit relation.

The approach is tested using binary classifica-
tion between relations on balanced data, a setting
very different from that of any realistic applica-
tion. For example, a question-answering appli-
cation that needs to identify causal relations (i.e.
as in Girju (2003)), must not only differentiate
causal relations from comparison relations, but
also from expansions, temporal relations, and pos-
sibly no relation at all. In addition, using equal
numbers of examples of each type can be mislead-
ing because the distribution of relations is known
to be skewed, with expansions occurring most fre-
quently. Causal and comparison relations, which
are most useful for applications, are less frequent.
Because of this, the recall of the classification
should be the primary metric of success, while
the Marcu and Echihabi (2001) experiments report
only accuracy.

Later work (Blair-Goldensohn et al., 2007;
Sporleder and Lascarides, 2008) has discovered
that the models learned do not perform as well on
implicit relations as one might expect from the test
accuracies on synthetic data.

3 Penn Discourse Treebank

For our experiments, we use the Penn Discourse
Treebank (PDTB; Prasad et al., 2008), the largest
available annotated corpora of discourse relations.
The PDTB contains discourse annotations over the
same 2,312 Wall Street Journal (WSJ) articles as
the Penn Treebank.

For each explicit discourse connective (such as
“but” or “so”), annotators identified the two text
spans between which the relation holds and the
sense of the relation.

The PDTB also provides information about lo-
cal implicit relations. For each pair of adjacent
sentences within the same paragraph, annotators
selected the explicit discourse connective which
best expressed the relation between the sentences
and then assigned a sense to the relation. In Exam-
ple (1) above, the annotators identified “because”
as the most appropriate connective between the
sentences, and then labeled the implicit discourse
relation Contingency.

In the PDTB, explicit and implicit relations are
clearly distinguished, allowing us to concentrate
solely on the implicit relations.

As mentioned above, each implicit and explicit
relation is annotated with a sense. The senses
are arranged in a hierarchy, allowing for annota-
tions as specific as Contingency.Cause.reason. In
our experiments, we use only the top level of the
sense annotations: Comparison, Contingency, Ex-
pansion, and Temporal. Using just these four rela-
tions allows us to be theory-neutral; while differ-
ent frameworks (Hobbs, 1979; McKeown, 1985;
Mann and Thompson, 1988; Knott and Sanders,
1998; Asher and Lascarides, 2003) include differ-
ent relations of varying specificities, all of them
include these four core relations, sometimes under
different names.

Each relation in the PDTB takes two arguments.
Example (1) can be seen as the predicate Con-
tingency which takes the two sentences as argu-
ments. For implicits, the span in the first sentence
is called Arg1 and the span in the following sen-
tence is called Arg2.

4 Word pair features in prior work

Cross product of words Discourse connectives
are the most reliable predictors of the semantic
sense of the relation (Marcu, 2000; Pitler et al.,
2008). However, in the absence of explicit mark-
ers, the most easily accessible features are the

684



words in the two text spans of the relation. In-
tuitively, one would expect that there is some rela-
tionship that holds between the words in the two
arguments. Consider for example the following
sentences:
The recent explosion of country funds mirrors the ”closed-

end fund mania” of the 1920s, Mr. Foot says, when narrowly

focused funds grew wildly popular. They fell into oblivion
after the 1929 crash.

The words “popular” and “oblivion” are almost
antonyms, and one might hypothesize that their
occurrence in the two text spans is what triggers
the contrast relation between the sentences. Sim-
ilarly, a pair of words such as (rain, rot) might be
indicative of a causal relation. If this hypothesis is
correct, pairs of words (w1, w2) such that w1 ap-
pears in the first sentence and w2 appears in the
second sentence would be good features for iden-
tifying contrast relations.

Indeed, word pairs form the basic feature
of most previous work on classifying implicit
relations (Marcu and Echihabi, 2001; Blair-
Goldensohn et al., 2007; Sporleder and Las-
carides, 2008) or the simpler task of predicting
which connective should be used to express a rela-
tion (Lapata and Lascarides, 2004).

Semantic relations vs. function word pairs If
the hypothesis for word pair triggers of discourse
relations were true, the analysis of unambiguous
relations can be used to discover pairs of words
with causal or contrastive relations holding be-
tween them. Yet, feature analysis has not been per-
formed in prior studies to establish or refute this
possibility.

At the same time, feature selection is always
necessary for word pairs, which are numerous and
lead to data sparsity problems. Here, we present a
meta analysis of the feature selection work in three
prior studies.

One approach for reducing the number of fea-
tures follows the hypothesis of semantic rela-
tions between words. Marcu and Echihabi (2001)
considered only nouns, verbs and and other cue
phrases in word pairs. They found that even
with millions of training examples, prediction re-
sults using all words were superior to those based
on only pairs of non-function words. However,
since the learning curve is steeper when function
words were removed, they hypothesize that using
only non-function words will outperform using all
words once enough training data is available.

In a similar vein, Lapata and Lascarides (2004)
used pairings of only verbs, nouns and adjectives
for predicting which temporal connective is most
suitable to express the relation between two given
text spans. Verb pairs turned out to be one of the
best features, but no useful information was ob-
tained using nouns and adjectives.

Blair-Goldensohn et al. (2007) proposed sev-
eral refinements of the word pair model. They
show that (i) stemming, (ii) using a small fixed
vocabulary size consisting of only the most fre-
quent stems (which would tend to be dominated
by function words) and (iii) a cutoff on the mini-
mum frequency of a feature, all result in improved
performance. They also report that filtering stop-
words has a negative impact on the results.

Given these findings, we expect that pairs of
function words are informative features helpful in
predicting discourse relation sense. In our work
that we describe next, we use feature selection to
investigate the word pairs in detail.

5 Analysis of word pair features

For the analysis of word pair features, we use
a large collection of automatically extracted ex-
plicit examples from the experiments in Blair-
Goldensohn et al. (2007). The data, from now on
referred to as TextRels, has explicit contrast and
causal relations which were extracted from the En-
glish Gigaword Corpus (Graff, 2003) which con-
tains over four million newswire articles.

The explicit cue phrase is removed from each
example and the spans are treated as belonging to
an implicit relation. Besides cause and contrast,
the TextRels data include a no-relation category
which consists of sentences from the same text that
are separated by at least three other sentences.

To identify features useful for classifying com-
parison vs other relations, we chose a random sam-
ple of 5000 examples for Contrast and 5000 Other
relations (2500 each of Cause and No-relation).
For the complete set of 10,000 examples, word
pair features were computed. After removing
word pairs that appear less than 5 times, the re-
maining features were ranked by information gain
using the MALLET toolkit1.

Table 1 lists the word pairs with highest infor-
mation gain for the Contrast vs. Other and Cause
vs. Other classification tasks. All contain very fre-
quent stop words, and interestingly for the Con-

1mallet.cs.umass.edu

685



trast vs. Other task, most of the word pairs contain
discourse connectives.

This is certainly unexpected, given that word
pairs were formed by deleting the discourse con-
nectives from the sentences expressing Contrast.
Word pairs containing “but” as one of their ele-
ments in fact signal the presence of a relation that
is not Contrast.

Consider the example shown below:
The government says it has reached most isolated townships

by now, but because roads are blocked, getting anything but

basic food supplies to people remains difficult.

Following Marcu and Echihabi (2001), the pair
[The government says it has reached most isolated
townships by now, but] and [roads are blocked,
getting anything but basic food supplies to peo-
ple remains difficult.] is created as an example of
the Cause relation. Because of examples like this,
“but-but” is a very useful word pair feature indi-
cating Cause, as the but would have been removed
for the artifical Contrast examples. In fact, the top
17 features for classifying Contrast versus Other
all contain the word “but”, and are indications that
the relation is Other.

These findings indicate an unexpected anoma-
lous effect in the use of synthetic data. Since re-
lations are created by removing connectives, if an
unambiguous connective remains, its presence is a
reliable indicator that the example should be clas-
sified as Other. Such features might work well and
lead to high accuracy results in identifying syn-
thetic implicit relations, but are unlikely to be use-
ful in a realistic setting of actual implicits.

Table 1: Word pairs with highest information gain.

Also note that the only two features predic-
tive of the comparison class (indicated by * in
Table 1): the-it and to-it, contain only func-
tion words rather than semantically related non-
function words. This ranking explains the obser-
vations reported in Blair-Goldensohn et al. (2007)
where removing stopwords degraded classifier
performance and why using only nouns, verbs or
adjectives (Marcu and Echihabi, 2001; Lapata and

Lascarides, 2004) is not the best option2.

6 Features for sense prediction of
implicit discourse relations

The contrast between the “popular”/“oblivion” ex-
ample we started with above can be analyzed in
terms of lexical relations (near antonyms), but also
could be explained by different polarities of the
two words: “popular” is generally a positive word,
while “oblivion” has negative connotations.

While we agree that the actual words in the ar-
guments are quite useful, we also define several
higher-level features corresponding to various se-
mantic properties of the words. The words in the
two text spans of a relation are taken from the
gold-standard annotations in the PDTB.

Polarity Tags: We define features that represent
the sentiment of the words in the two spans. Each
word’s polarity was assigned according to its en-
try in the Multi-perspective Question Answering
Opinion Corpus (Wilson et al., 2005). In this re-
source, each sentiment word is annotated as posi-
tive, negative, both, or neutral. We use the number
of negated and non-negated positive, negative, and
neutral sentiment words in the two text spans as
features. If a writer refers to something as “nice”
in Arg1, that counts towards the positive sentiment
count (Arg1Positive); “not nice” would count to-
wards Arg1NegatePositive. A sentiment word is
negated if a word with a General Inquirer (Stone
et al., 1966) Negate tag precedes it. We also have
features for the cross products of these polarities
between Arg1 and Arg2.

We expected that these features could help
Comparison examples especially. Consider the
following example:

Executives at Time Inc. Magazine Co., a subsidiary of

Time Warner, have said the joint venture with Mr. Lang

wasn’t a good one. The venture, formed in 1986, was sup-

posed to be Time’s low-cost, safe entry into women’s maga-

zines.

The word good is annotated with positive po-
larity, however it is negated. Safe is tagged as
having positive polarity, so this opposition could
indicate the Comparison relation between the two
sentences.

Inquirer Tags: To get at the meanings of the
spans, we look up what semantic categories each

2In addition, an informal inspection of 100 word pairs
with high information gain for Contrast vs. Other (the longest
word pairs were chosen, as those are more likely to be content
words) found only six semantically opposed pairs.

686



word falls into according to the General Inquirer
lexicon (Stone et al., 1966). The General In-
quirer has classes for positive and negative polar-
ity, as well as more fine-grained categories such as
words related to virtue or vice. The Inquirer even
contains a category called “Comp” that includes
words that tend to indicate Comparison, such as
“optimal”, “other”, “supreme”, or “ultimate”.

Several of the categories are complementary:
Understatement versus Overstatement, Rise ver-
sus Fall, or Pleasure versus Pain. Pairs where one
argument contains words that indicate Rise and the
other argument indicates Fall might be good evi-
dence for a Comparison relation.

The benefit of using these tags instead of just
the word pairs is that we see more observations for
each semantic class than for any particular word,
reducing the data sparsity problem. For example,
the pair rose:fell often indicates a Comparison re-
lation when speaking about stocks. However, oc-
casionally authors refer to stock prices as “jump-
ing” rather than “rising”. Since both jump and rise
are members of the Rise class, new jump examples
can be classified using past rise examples.

Development testing showed that including fea-
tures for all words’ tags was not useful, so we in-
clude the Inquirer tags of only the verbs in the two
arguments and their cross-product. Just as for the
polarity features, we include features for both each
tag and its negation.

Money/Percent/Num: If two adjacent sen-
tences both contain numbers, dollar amounts, or
percentages, it is likely that a comparison rela-
tion might hold between the sentences. We in-
cluded a feature for the count of numbers, percent-
ages, and dollar amounts in Arg1 and Arg2. We
also included the number of times each combina-
tion of number/percent/dollar occurs in Arg1 and
Arg2. For example, if Arg1 mentions a percent-
age and Arg2 has two dollar amounts, the feature
Arg1Percent-Arg2Money would have a count of 2.
This feature is probably genre-dependent. Num-
bers and percentages often appear in financial texts
but would be less frequent in other genres.

WSJ-LM: This feature represents the extent to
which the words in the text spans are typical of
each relation. For each sense, we created uni-
gram and bigram language models over the im-
plicit examples in the training set. We compute
each example’s probability according to each of
these language models. The features are the ranks

of the spans’ likelihoods according to the vari-
ous language models. For example, if of the un-
igram models, the most likely relation to generate
this example was Contingency, then the example
would include the feature ContingencyUnigram1.
If the third most likely relation according to the
bigram models was Expansion, then it would in-
clude the feature ExpansionBigram3.

Expl-LM: This feature ranks the text spans ac-
cording to language models derived from the ex-
plicit examples in the TextRels corpus. However,
the corpus contains only Cause, Contrast and No-
relation, hence we expect the WSJ language mod-
els to be more helpful.

Verbs: These features include the number of
pairs of verbs in Arg1 and Arg2 from the same
verb class. Two verbs are from the same verb class
if each of their highest Levin verb class (Levin,
1993) levels (in the LCS Database (Dorr, 2001))
are the same. The intuition behind this feature is
that the more related the verbs, the more likely the
relation is an Expansion.

The verb features also include the average
length of verb phrases in each argument, as well
as the cross product of this feature for the two ar-
guments. We hypothesized that verb chunks that
contain more words, such as “They [are allowed to
proceed]” often contain rationales afterwards (sig-
nifying Contingency relations), while short verb
phrases like “They proceed” might occur more of-
ten in Expansion or Temporal relations.

Our final verb features were the part of speech
tags (gold-standard from the Penn Treebank) of
the main verb. One would expect that Expansion
would link sentences with the same tense, whereas
Contingency and Temporal relations would con-
tain verbs with different tenses.

First-Last, First3: The first and last words of
a relation’s arguments have been found to be par-
ticularly useful for predicting its sense (Wellner et
al., 2006). Wellner et al. (2006) suggest that these
words are such predictive features because they
are often explicit discourse connectives. In our
experiments on implicits, the first and last words
are not connectives. However, some implicits have
been found to be related by connective-like ex-
pressions which often appear in the beginning of
the second argument. In the PDTB, these are an-
notated as alternatively lexicalized relations (Al-
tLexes). To capture such effects, we included the
first and last words of Arg1 as features, the first

687



and last words of Arg2, the pair of the first words
of Arg1 and Arg2, and the pair of the last words.
We also add two additional features which indicate
the first three words of each argument.

Modality: Modal words, such as “can”,
“should”, and “may”, are often used to express
conditional statements (i.e. “If I were a wealthy
man, I wouldn’t have to work hard.”) thus signal-
ing a Contingency relation. We include a feature
for the presence or absence of modals in Arg1 and
Arg2, features for specific modal words, and their
cross-products.

Context: Some implicit relations appear imme-
diately before or immediately after certain explicit
relations far more often than one would expect due
to chance (Pitler et al., 2008). We define a feature
indicating if the immediately preceding (or follow-
ing) relation was an explicit. If it was, we include
the connective trigger of the relation and its sense
as features. We use oracle annotations of the con-
nective sense, however, most of the connectives
are unambiguous.

One might expect a different distribution of re-
lation types in the beginning versus further in the
middle of a paragraph. We capture paragraph-
position information using a feature which indi-
cates if Arg1 begins a paragraph.

Word pairs Four variants of word pair mod-
els were used in our experiments. All the models
were eventually tested on implicit examples from
the PDTB, but the training set-up was varied.

Wordpairs-TextRels In this setting, we trained
a model on word pairs derived from unannotated
text (TextRels corpus).

Wordpairs-PDTBImpl Word pairs for training
were formed from the cross product of words in
the textual spans (Arg1 x Arg2) of the PDTB im-
plicit relations.

Wordpairs-selected Here, only word pairs from
Wordpairs-PDTBImpl with non-zero information
gain on the TextRels corpus were retained.

Wordpairs-PDTBExpl In this case, the model
was formed by using the word pairs from the ex-
plicit relations in the sections of the PDTB used
for training.

7 Classification Results

For all experiments, we used sections 2-20 of the
PDTB for training and sections 21-22 for testing.
Sections 0-1 were used as a development set for
feature design.

We ran four binary classification tasks to iden-
tify each of the main relations from the rest. As
each of the relations besides Expansion are infre-
quent, we train using equal numbers of positive
and negative examples of the target relation. The
negative examples were chosen at random. We
used all of sections 21 and 22 for testing, so the
test set is representative of the natural distribution.

The training sets contained: Comparison (1927
positive, 1927 negative), Contingency (3500
each), Expansion3 (6356 each), and Temporal
(730 each).

The test set contained: 151 examples of Com-
parison, 291 examples of Contingency, 986 exam-
ples of Expansion, 82 examples of Temporal, and
13 examples of No-relation.

We used Naive Bayes, Maximum Entropy
(MaxEnt), and AdaBoost (Freund and Schapire,
1996) classifiers implemented in MALLET.

7.1 Non-Wordpair Features

The performance using only our semantically in-
formed features is shown in Table 7. Only the
Naive Bayes classification results are given, as
space is limited and MaxEnt and AdaBoost gave
slightly lower accuracies overall.

The table lists the f-score for each of the target
relations, with overall accuracy shown in brack-
ets. Given that the experiments are run on natural
distribution of the data, which are skewed towards
Expansion relations, the f-score is the more impor-
tant measure to track.

Our random baseline is the f-score one would
achieve by randomly assigning classes in propor-
tion to its true distribution in the test set. The best
results for all four tasks are considerably higher
than random prediction, but still low overall. Our
features provide 6% to 18% absolute improve-
ments in f-score over the baseline for each of the
four tasks. The largest gain was in the Contin-
gency versus Other prediction task. The least im-
provement was for distinguishing Expansion ver-
sus Other. However, since Expansion forms the
largest class of relations, its f-score is still the
highest overall. We discuss the results per relation
class next.

Comparison We expected that polarity features
would be especially helpful for identifying Com-

3The PDTB also contains annotations of entity relations,
which most frameworks consider a subset of Expansion.
Thus, we include relations annotated as EntRel as positive
examples of Expansion.

parison relations. Surprisingly, polarity was actu-
ally one of the worst classes of features for Com-
parison, achieving an f-score of 16.33 (in contrast
to using the first, last and first three words of the
sentences as features, which leads to an f-score of
21.01). We examined the prevalence of positive-
negative or negative-positive polarity pairs in our
training set. 30% of the Comparison examples
contain one of these opposite polarity pairs, while
31% of the Other examples contain an opposite
polarity pair. To our knowledge, this is the first
study to examine the prevalence of polarity words
in the arguments of discourse relations in their
natural distributions. Contrary to popular belief,
Comparisons do not tend to have more opposite
polarity pairs.

The two most useful classes of features for rec-
ognizing Comparison relations were the first, last
and first three words in the sentence and the con-
text features that indicate the presence of a para-
graph boundary or of an explicit relation just be-
fore or just after the location of the hypothesized
implicit relation (19.32 f-score).

Contingency The two best features for the Con-
tingency vs. Other distinction were verb informa-
tion (36.59 f-score) and first, last and first three
words in the sentence (36.75 f-score). Context
again was one of the features that led to improve-
ment. This makes sense, as Pitler et al. (2008)
found that implicit contingencies are often found
immediately following explicit comparisons.

We were surprised that the polarity features
were helpful for Contingency but not Comparison.
Again we looked at the prevalence of opposite po-
larity pairs. While for Comparison versus Other
there was not a significant difference, for Contin-
gency there are quite a few more opposite polarity
pairs (52%) than for not Contingency (41%).

The language model features were completely
useless for distinguishing contingencies from

other relations.
Expansion As Expansion is the majority class

in the natural distribution, recall is less of a prob-
lem than precision. The features that help achieve
the best f-score are all features that were found to
be useful in identifying other relations.

Polarity tags, Inquirer tags and context were
the best features for identifying expansions with
f-scores around 70%.

Temporal Implicit temporal relations are rela-
tively rare, making up only about 5% of our test
set. Most temporal relations are explicitly marked
with a connective like “when” or “after”.

Yet again, the first and last words of the sen-
tence turned out to be useful indicators for tem-
poral relations (15.93 f-score). The importance of
the first and last words for this distinction is clear.
It derives from the fact that temporal implicits of-
ten contain words like “yesterday” or “Monday” at
the end of the sentence. Context is the next most
helpful feature for temporal relations.

7.2 Which word pairs help?

For Comparison and Contingency, we analyze the
behavior of word pair features under several differ-
ent settings. Specifically we want to address two
important related questions raised in recent work
by others: (i) is unannotated data from explicits
useful for training models that disambiguate im-
plicit discourse relations and (ii) are explicit and
implicit relations intrinsically different from each
other.

Wordpairs-TextRels is the worst approach. The
best use of word pair features is Wordpairs-
selected. This model gives 4% better absolute f-
score for Comparison and 14% for Contingency
over Wordpairs-TextRels. In this setting the Tex-
tRels data was used to choose the word pair fea-
tures, but the probabilities for each feature were
estimated using the training portion of the PDTB

implicit examples.
We also confirm that even within the PDTB,

information from annotated explicit relations
(Wordpairs-PDTBExpl) is not as helpful as
information from annotated implicit relations
(Wordpairs-PDTBImpl). The absolute difference
in f-score between the two models is close to 2%
for Comparison, and 6% for Contingency.

7.3 Best results

Adding other features to word pairs leads to im-
proved performance for Contingency, Expansion
and Temporal relations, but not for Comparison.

For contingency detection, the best combina-
tion of our features included polarity, verb in-
formation, first and last words, modality, context
with Wordpairs-selected. This combination led
to a definite improvement, reaching an f-score of
47.13 (16% absolute improvement in f-score over
Wordpairs-TextRels).

For detecting expansions, the best combination
of our features (polarity+Inquirer tags+context)
outperformed Wordpairs-PDTBImpl by a wide
margin, close to 13% absolute improvement (f-
scores of 76.42 and 63.84 respectively).

7.4 Sequence Model of Discourse Relations

Our results from the previous section show that
classification of implicits benefits from informa-
tion about nearby relations, and so we expected

improvements using a sequence model, rather than
classifying each relation independently.

We trained a CRF classifier (Lafferty et al.,
2001) over the sequence of implicit examples from
all documents in sections 02 to 20. The test set
is the same as used for the 2-way classifiers. We
compare against a 6-way4 Naive Bayes classifier.
Only word pairs were used as features for both.
Overall 6-way prediction accuracy is 43.27% for
the Naive Bayes model and 44.58% for the CRF
model.

8 Conclusion

We have presented the first study that predicts im-
plicit discourse relations in a realistic setting (dis-
tinguishing a relation of interest from all others,
where the relations occur in their natural distri-
butions). Also unlike prior work, we separate the
task from the easier task of explicit discourse pre-
diction. Our experiments demonstrate that fea-
tures developed to capture word polarity, verb
classes and orientation, as well as some lexical
features are strong indicators of the type of dis-
course relation.

We analyze word pair features used in prior
work that were intended to capture such semantic
oppositions. We show that the features in fact do
not capture semantic relation but rather give infor-
mation about function word co-occurrences. How-
ever, they are still a useful source of information
for discourse relation prediction. The most bene-
ficial application of such features is when they are
selected from a large unannotated corpus of ex-
plicit relations, but then trained on manually an-
notated implicit relations.

Context, in terms of paragraph boundaries and
nearby explicit relations, also proves to be useful
for the prediction of implicit discourse relations.
It is helpful when added as a feature in a standard,
instance-by-instance learning model. A sequence
model also leads to over 1% absolute improvement
for the task.
