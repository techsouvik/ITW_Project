Abstract

Monolingual translation probabilities have
recently been introduced in retrieval mod-
els to solve the lexical gap problem.
They can be obtained by training statisti-
cal translation models on parallel mono-
lingual corpora, such as question-answer
pairs, where answers act as the “source”
language and questions as the “target”
language. In this paper, we propose
to use as a parallel training dataset the
definitions and glosses provided for the
same term by different lexical semantic re-
sources. We compare monolingual trans-
lation models built from lexical semantic
resources with two other kinds of datasets:
manually-tagged question reformulations
and question-answer pairs. We also show
that the monolingual translation probabil-
ities obtained (i) are comparable to tradi-
tional semantic relatedness measures and
(ii) significantly improve the results over
the query likelihood and the vector-space
model for answer finding.

1 Introduction

The lexical gap (or lexical chasm) often observed
between queries and documents or questions and
answers is a pervasive problem both in Informa-
tion Retrieval (IR) and Question Answering (QA).
This problem arises from alternative ways of con-
veying the same information, due to synonymy
or paraphrasing, and is especially severe for re-
trieval over shorter documents, such as sentence
retrieval or question retrieval in Question & An-
swer archives. Several solutions to this problem
have been proposed including query expansion
(Riezler et al., 2007; Fang, 2008), query refor-
mulation or paraphrasing (Hermjakob et al., 2002;
Tomuro, 2003; Zukerman and Raskutti, 2002)

and semantic information retrieval (Müller et al.,
2007).

Berger and Lafferty (1999) have formulated a
further solution to the lexical gap problem con-
sisting in integrating monolingual statistical trans-
lation models in the retrieval process. Monolin-
gual translation models encode statistical word as-
sociations which are trained on parallel monolin-
gual corpora. The major drawback of this ap-
proach lies in the limited availability of truly par-
allel monolingual corpora. In practice, training
data for translation-based retrieval often consist in
question-answer pairs, usually extracted from the
evaluation corpus itself (Riezler et al., 2007; Xue
et al., 2008; Lee et al., 2008). While collection-
specific translation models effectively encode sta-
tistical word associations for the target document
collection, it also introduces a bias in the evalua-
tion and makes it difficult to assess the quality of
the translation model per se, independently from a
specific task and document collection.

In this paper, we propose new kinds of
datasets for training domain-independent mono-
lingual translation models. We use the defini-
tions and glosses provided for the same term
by different lexical semantic resources to auto-
matically train the translation models. This ap-
proach has been very recently made possible by
the emergence of new kinds of lexical seman-
tic and encyclopedic resources such as Wikipedia
and Wiktionary. These resources are freely avail-
able, up-to-date and have a broad coverage and
good quality. Thanks to the combination of sev-
eral resources, it is possible to obtain monolin-
gual parallel corpora which are large enough to
train domain-independent translation models. In
addition, we collected question-answer pairs and
manually-tagged question reformulations from a
social Q&A site. We use these datasets to build
further translation models.

Translation-based retrieval models have been

728



widely used in practice by the IR and QA commu-
nity. However, the quality of the semantic infor-
mation encoded in the translation tables has never
been assessed intrinsically. To do so, we com-
pare translation probabilities with concept vector
based semantic relatedness measures with respect
to human relatedness rankings for reference word
pairs. This study provides empirical evidence for
the high quality of the semantic information en-
coded in statistical word translation tables. We
then use the translation models in an answer find-
ing task based on a new question-answer dataset
which is totally independent from the resources
used for training the translation models. This ex-
trinsic evaluation shows that our translation mod-
els significantly improve the results over the query
likelihood and the vector-space model.

The remainder of the paper is organised as fol-
lows. Section 2 discusses related work on seman-
tic relatedness and statistical translation models
for retrieval. Section 3 presents the monolingual
parallel datasets we used for obtaining monolin-
gual translation probabilities. Semantic related-
ness experiments are detailed in Section 4. Section
5 presents answer finding experiments. Finally, we
conclude in Section 6.

2 Related Work

2.1 Statistical Translation Models for
Retrieval

Statistical translation models for retrieval have
first been introduced by Berger and Lafferty
(1999). These models attempt to address syn-
onymy and polysemy problems by encoding sta-
tistical word associations trained on monolingual
parallel corpora. This method offers several ad-
vantages. First, it bases upon a sound mathe-
matical formulation of the retrieval model. Sec-
ond, it is not as computationally expensive as
other semantic retrieval models, since it only re-
lies on a word translation table which can easily
be computed before retrieval. The main draw-
back lies in the availability of suitable training data
for the translation probabilities. Berger and Laf-
ferty (1999) initially built synthetic training data
consisting of queries automatically generated from
documents. Berger et al. (2000) proposed to train
translation models on question-answer pairs taken
from Usenet FAQs and call-center dialogues, with
answers corresponding to the “source” language
and questions to the “target” language.

Subsequent work in this area often used simi-
lar kinds of training data such as question-answer
pairs from Yahoo! Answers (Lee et al., 2008) or
from the Wondir site (Xue et al., 2008). Lee et
al. (2008) tried to further improve translation mod-
els based on question-answer pairs by selecting the
most important terms to build compact translation
models.

Other kinds of training data have also been pro-
posed. Jeon et al. (2005) automatically clustered
semantically similar questions based on their an-
swers. Murdock and Croft (2005) created a first
parallel corpus of synonym pairs extracted from
WordNet, and an additional parallel corpus of En-
glish words translating to the same Arabic term in
a parallel English-Arabic corpus.

Similar work has also been performed in the
area of query expansion using training data con-
sisting of FAQ pages (Riezler et al., 2007) or
queries and clicked snippets from query logs (Rie-
zler et al., 2008).

All in all, translation models have been shown
to significantly improve the retrieval results
over traditional baselines for document retrieval
(Berger and Lafferty, 1999), question retrieval in
Question & Answer archives (Jeon et al., 2005;
Lee et al., 2008; Xue et al., 2008) and for sentence
retrieval (Murdock and Croft, 2005).

Many of the approaches previously described
have used parallel data extracted from the retrieval
corpus itself. The translation models obtained are
therefore domain and collection-specific, which
introduces a bias in the evaluation and makes
it difficult to assess to what extent the transla-
tion model may be re-used for other tasks and
document collections. We henceforth propose a
new approach for building monolingual transla-
tion models relying on domain-independent lexi-
cal semantic resources. Moreover, we extensively
compare the results obtained by these models with
models obtained from a different type of dataset,
namely Question & Answer archives.

2.2 Semantic Relatedness

The rationale behind translation-based retrieval
models is that monolingual translation probabil-
ities encode some form of semantic knowledge.
The semantic similarity and relatedness of words
has traditionally been assessed through corpus-
based and knowledge-based measures. Corpus-
based measures include Hyperspace Analogue to

729



Language (HAL) (Lund and Burgess, 1996) and
Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) (Landauer et al.,
1998). Knowledge-based measures rely on lexical
semantic resources such as WordNet and comprise
path length based measures (Rada et al., 1989)
and concept vector based measures (Qiu and Frei,
1993). These measures have recently also been ap-
plied to new collaboratively constructed resources
such as Wikipedia (Zesch et al., 2007) and Wik-
tionary (Zesch et al., 2008), with good results.

While classical measures of semantic related-
ness have been extensively studied and compared,
based on comparisons with human relatedness
judgements or word-choice problems, there is no
comparable intrinsic study of the relatedness mea-
sures obtained through word translation probabil-
ities. In this study, we use the correlation with
human rankings for reference word pairs to inves-
tigate how word translation probabilities compare
with traditional semantic relatedness measures. To
our knowledge, this is the first time that word-to-
word translation probabilities are used for ranking
word-pairs with respect to their semantic related-
ness.

3 Parallel Datasets

In order to obtain parallel training data for the
translation models, we collected three different
datasets: manually-tagged question reformula-
tions and question-answer pairs from the WikiAn-
swers social Q&A site (Section 3.1), and glosses
from WordNet, Wiktionary, Wikipedia and Simple
Wikipedia (Section 3.2).

3.1 Social Q&A Sites

Social Q&A sites, such as Yahoo! Answers and
AnswerBag, provide portals where users can ask
their own questions as well as answer questions
from other users.

For our experiments we collected a dataset of
questions and answers, as well as question refor-
mulations, from the WikiAnswers1 (WA) web site.
WikiAnswers is a social Q&A site similar to Ya-
hoo! Answers and AnswerBag. The main orig-
inality of WikiAnswers is that users might manu-
ally tag question reformulations in order to prevent
the duplication of answers to questions asking the
same thing in a different way. When a user enters
a question that is not already part of the question
repository, the web site displays a list of already

1http://wiki.answers.com/

existing questions similar to the one just asked by
the user. The user may then freely select the ques-
tion which paraphrases her question, if available.
The question reformulations thus labelled by the
users are stored in order to retrieve the same an-
swer when a given question reformulation is asked
again.

We collected question-answer pairs and ques-
tion reformulations from the WikiAnswers site.
The resulting dataset contains 480,190 questions
with answers.2 We use this dataset in order to train
two different translation models:

Question-Answer Pairs (WAQA) In this set-
ting, question-answer pairs are considered as a
parallel corpus. Two different forms of combi-
nations are possible: (Q,A), where questions act
as source and answers as target, and (A,Q), where
answers act as source and questions as target. Re-
cent work by Xue et al. (2008) has shown that the
best results are obtained by pooling the question-
answer pairs {(q, a)1, ..., (q, a)n} and the answer-
question pairs {(a, q)1, ..., (a, q)n} for training,
so that we obtain the following parallel corpus:
{(q, a)1, ..., (q, a)n}∪{(a, q)1, ..., (a, q)n}. Over-
all, this corpus contains 1,227,362 parallel pairs
and will be referred to as WAQA (WikiAnswers
Question-Answers) in the rest of the paper.

Question Reformulations (WAQ) In this set-
ting, question and question reformulation pairs
are considered as a parallel corpus, e.g. ‘How
long do polar bears live?’ and ‘What is
the polar bear lifespan?’. For a given
user question q1, we retrieve its stored re-
formulations from the WikiAnswers dataset;
q11, q12, .... The original question and reformu-
lations are subsequently combined and pooled to
obtain a parallel corpus of question reformula-
tion pairs: {(q1, q11), (q1, q12), ..., (qn, qnm)} ∪
{(q11, q1), (q12, q1), ..., (qnm, qn)}. This corpus
contains 4,379,620 parallel pairs and will be re-
ferred to as WAQ (WikiAnswers Questions) in the
rest of the paper.

3.2 Lexical Semantic Resources

Glosses and definitions for the same lexeme in dif-
ferent lexical semantic and encyclopedic resources
can actually be considered as near-paraphrases,
since they define the same terms and hence have

the same meaning, as shown by the following ex-
ample for the lexeme “moon”:

• Wordnet (sense 1): the natural satellite of the
Earth.
• English Wiktionary: The Moon, the satellite

of planet Earth.
• English Wikipedia: The Moon (Latin: Luna)

is Earth’s only natural satellite and the fifth
largest natural satellite in the Solar System.

We use glosses and definitions contained in the
following resources to build a parallel corpus:

• WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998). We use a freely
available API for WordNet (JWNL3) to ac-
cess WordNet 3.0.
• English Wiktionary. We use the Wiktionary

dump from January 11, 2009.
• English and Simple English Wikipedia. We

use the Wikipedia dump from February
6, 2007 and the Simple Wikipedia dump
from July 24, 2008. The Simple English
Wikipedia is an English Wikipedia targeted
at non-native speakers of English which uses
simpler words than the English Wikipedia.
Wikipedia and Simple Wikipedia articles do
not directly correspond to glosses such as
those found in dictionaries, we therefore con-
sidered the first paragraph in articles as a sur-
rogate for glosses.

Given a list of 86,584 seed lexemes extracted
from WordNet, we collected the glosses for each
lexeme from the four English resources described

3http://sourceforge.net/projects/
jwordnet/

above. We then built pairs of glosses by consid-
ering each possible pair of resource. Given that a
lexeme might have different senses, and hence dif-
ferent glosses, it is possible to extract several gloss
pairs for one and the same lexeme and one and the
same pair of resources. It is therefore necessary to
perform word sense alignment. As we do not need
perfect training data, but rather large amounts of
training data, we used a very simple method con-
sisting in eliminating gloss pairs which did not at
least have one lemma in common (excluding stop
words and the seed lexeme itself).

The final pooled parallel corpus contains
307,136 pairs and is henceforth much smaller
than the previous datasets extracted from WikiAn-
swers. This corpus will be referred to as LSR.

3.3 Translation Model Training

We used the GIZA++ SMT Toolkit4 (Och and
Ney, 2003) in order to obtain word-to-word
translation probabilities from the parallel datasets
described above. As is common practice in
translation-based retrieval, we utilised the IBM
translation model 1. The only pre-processing steps
performed for all parallel datasets were tokenisa-
tion and stop word removal.5

3.4 Comparison of Word-to-Word
Translations

Table 1 gives some examples of word-to-word
translations obtained for the different parallel cor-
pora used (the column ALLPool will be described
in the next section). As evidenced by this table,

able at: http://truereader.com/manuals/onix/
stopwords1.html.

731



the different kinds of data encode different types
of information, including semantic relatedness and
similarity, as well as morphological relatedness.
As could be expected, the quality of the “trans-
lations” is variable and heavily dependent on the
training data: the WAQ and WAQA models reveal
the users’ interests, while the LSR model encodes
lexicographic and encyclopedic knowledge. For
instance, “gem” is an acronym for “generic elec-
tronic module”, which is found in Ford vehicles.
Since many question-answer pairs in WA are re-
lated to cars, this very particular use of “gem” is
predominant in the WAQ and WAQA translation
tables.

3.5 Combination of the Datasets
In order to investigate the role played by differ-
ent kinds of training data, we combined the sev-
eral translation models, using the two methods de-
scribed by Xue et al. (2008). The first method con-
sists in a linear combination of the word-to-word
translation probabilities after training:

PLin(wi|wj) = αPWAQ(wi|wj)
+ γPWAQA(wi|wj)
+ δPLSR(wi|wj) (1)

where α + γ + δ = 1. This approach will be
labelled with the Lin subscript.

The second method consists in pooling the
training datasets, i.e. concatenating the parallel
corpora, before training. This approach will be
labelled with the Pool subscript. Examples for
word-to-word translations obtained with this type
of combination can be found in the last column for
each word in Table 1. The ALLPool setting corre-
sponds to the pooling of all three parallel datasets:
WAQ+WAQA+LSR.

4 Semantic Relatedness Experiments

The aim of this first experiment is to perform an
intrinsic evaluation of the word translation proba-
bilities obtained by comparing them to traditional
semantic relatedness measures on the task of rank-
ing word pairs. Human judgements of semantic re-
latedness can be used to evaluate how well seman-
tic relatedness measures reflect human rankings by
correlating their ranking results with Spearman’s
rank correlation coefficient. Several evaluation
datasets are available for English, but we restrict
our study to the larger dataset created by Finkel-
stein et al. (2002) due to the low coverage of many

pairs in the word-to-word translation tables. This
dataset comprises two subsets, which have been
annotated by different annotators: Fin1–153, con-
taining 153 word pairs, and Fin2–200, containing
200 word pairs.

Word-to-word translation probabilities are com-
pared with a concept vector based measure relying
on Explicit Semantic Analysis (Gabrilovich and
Markovitch, 2007), since this approach has been
shown to yield very good results (Zesch et al.,
2008). The method consists in representing words
as a concept vector, where concepts correspond to
WordNet synsets, Wikipedia article titles or Wik-
tionary entry names. Concept vectors for each
word are derived from the textual representation
available for each concept, i.e. glosses in Word-
Net, the full article or the first paragraph of the
article in Wikipedia or the full contents of a Wik-
tionary entry. We refer the reader to (Gabrilovich
and Markovitch, 2007; Zesch et al., 2008) for tech-
nical details on how the concept vectors are built
and used to obtain semantic relatedness values.

Table 2 lists Spearman’s rank correlation coeffi-
cients obtained for concept vector based measures
and translation probabilities. In order to ensure
a fair evaluation, we limit the comparison to the
word pairs which are contained in all resources
and translation tables.

on the Fin1-153 and Fin2-200 datasets. Best val-
ues for each dataset are in bold format. For
WikipediaFirst, the concept vectors are based on
the first paragraph of each article.

The first observation is that the coverage over
the two evaluation datasets is rather small: only 46
pairs have been evaluated for the Fin1-153 dataset
and 42 for the Fin2-200 dataset. This is mainly

732



due to the natural absence of many word pairs in
the translation tables. Indeed, translation proba-
bilities can only be obtained from observed paral-
lel pairs in the training data. Concept vector based
measures are more flexible in that respect since the
relatedness value is based on a common represen-
tation in a concept vector space. It is therefore
possible to measure relatedness for a far greater
number of word pairs, as long as they share some
concept vector dimensions. The second observa-
tion is that, on the restricted subset of word pairs
considered, the results obtained by word-to-word
translation probabilities are most of the time better
than those of concept vector measures. However,
the differences are not statistically significant.6

5 Answer Finding Experiments

5.1 Retrieval based on Translation Models
The second experiment aims at providing an ex-
trinsic evaluation of the translation probabilities
by employing them in an answer finding task.
In order to perform retrieval, we use a rank-
ing function similar to the one proposed by Xue
et al. (2008), which builds upon previous work
on translation-based retrieval models and tries to
overcome some of their flaws:

P (q|D) =
∏
w∈q

P (w|D) (2)

P (w|D) = (1− λ)Pmx(w|D) + λP (w|C) (3)

Pmx(w|D) = (1− β)Pml(w|D) +
β

∑
t∈D

P (w|t)Pml(t|D) (4)

where q is the query, D the document, λ the
smoothing parameter for the document collection
C and P (w|t) is the probability of translating a
document term t to the query term w.

The only difference to the original model by
Xue et al. (2008) is that we use Jelinek-Mercer
smoothing for equation 3 instead of Dirichlet
Smoothing, as it has been done by Jeon et al.
(2005). In all our experiments, β was set to 0.8
and λ to 0.5.

5.2 The Microsoft Research QA Corpus
We performed an extrinsic evaluation of mono-
lingual word translation probabilities by integrat-
ing them in the retrieval model previously de-
scribed for an answer finding task. To this aim,

6Fisher-Z transformation, two-tailed test with α=.05.

we used the questions and answers contained in
the Microsoft Research Question Answering Cor-
pus.7 This corpus comprises approximately 1.4K
questions collected from 10-13 year old school-
children, who were asked “If you could talk to an
encyclopedia, what would you ask it?”. The an-
swers to the questions have been manually identi-
fied in the full text of Encarta 98 and annotated
with the following relevance judgements: exact
answer (1), off topic (3), on topic - off target (4),
partial answer (5). In order to use this dataset for
an answer finding task, we consider the annotated
answers as the documents to be retrieved and use
the questions as the set of test queries.

This corpus is particularly well suited to con-
duct experiments targeted at the lexical gap prob-
lem: only 28% of the question-answer pairs corre-
spond to a strong match (two or more query terms
in the same answer sentence), while about a half
(52%) are a weak match (only one query term
matched in the answer sentence) and 16 % are in-
direct answers which do not explicitly contain the
answer but provide enough information for deduc-
ing it. Moreover, the Microsoft QA corpus is not
limited to a specific topic and entirely indepen-
dent from the datasets used to build our translation
models.

The original corpus contained some inconsis-
tencies due to duplicated data and non-labelled
entries. After cleaning, we obtained a corpus of
1,364 questions and 9,780 answers. Table 3 gives
one example of a question with different answers
and relevance judgements.

We report the retrieval performance in terms
of Mean Average Precision (MAP) and Mean R-
Precision (R-prec), MAP being our primary evalu-
ation metric. We consider the following relevance
categories, corresponding to increasing levels of
tolerance for inexact or partial answers:

• MAP1, R-Prec1: exact answer (1)

• MAP1,5, R-Prec1,5: exact answer (1) or par-
tial answer (5)

• MAP1,4,5, R-Prec1,4,5: exact answer (1) or
partial answer (5) or on topic - off target (4)

Similarly to the training data for translation
models, the only pre-processing steps performed

Partial answer Solar Energy, radiant energy produced in the sun as a result of nuclear fu-
sion reactions (see Nuclear Energy; Sun).

The performance gaps between the translation-based models and the baseline models are statistically
significant, except for those marked with a ‘*’ (two-tailed paired t-test, p < 0.05).

for this corpus were tokenisation and stop word
removal. Due to the small size of the answer
corpus, we built an open vocabulary background
collection model to deal with out of vocabulary
words by smoothing the unigram probabilities
with Good-Turing discounting, using the SRILM
toolkit8 (Stolcke, 2002).

5.3 Results

As baselines, we consider the query-likelihood
model (QLM), corresponding to equation 4 with
β = 0, and Lucene.9

The results reported in Table 4 show that models
incorporating monolingual translation probabili-
ties perform consistently better than both baseline
systems especially when they are used in combi-
nation. It is however difficult to provide a ranking
of the different types of training data based on the
retrieval results: it seems that LSR is slightly more
performant than WAQ and WAQA, both alone and

8http://www.speech.sri.com/projects/
srilm/

9http://lucene.apache.org

in combination, but the improvement is minor. It
is worth noticing that while the LSR training data
are comparatively smaller than WAQ and WAQA,
they however yield comparable results. The linear
combination of datasets (WAQ+WAQA+LSRLin)
yields statistically significant performance im-
provement when compared to the models without
combinations (except when compared to WAQA
for R-Prec1, p>0.05), which shows that the differ-
ent datasets and resources used are complemen-
tary and each contribute to the overall result.

Three answer retrieval examples are given in
Figure 1. They provide further evidence for
the results obtained. The correct answer to the
first question “Who invented Halloween?” is
retrieved by the WAQ+WAQA+LSRLin model,
but not by the QLM. This is a case of a weak
match with only “Halloween” as matching term.
The WAQ+WAQA+LSRLin model is however able
to establish the connection between the ques-
tion term “invented” and the answer term “orig-
inated”. Questions 2 and 3 show that transla-
tion probabilities can also replace word normali-

Question 1: Who invented Halloween?
Halloween occurs on October 31 and is observed
in the U.S. and other countries with masquerad-
ing, bonfires, and games.

The observances connected with Halloween are
thought to have originated among the ancient
Druids, who believed that on that evening,
Saman, the lord of the dead, called forth hosts
of evil spirits.

Question 2: Can mosquito bites spread AIDS?
Another species, the Asian tiger mosquito, has
caused health experts concern since it was first
detected in the United States in 1985. Proba-
bly arriving in shipments of used tire casings,
this fierce biter can spread a type of encephalitis,
dengue fever, and other diseases.

Studies have shown no evidence of HIV trans-
mission through insects – even in areas where
there are many cases of AIDS and large popu-
lations of insects such as mosquitoes.

Question 3: How do the mountains form into a shape?
In 1985, scientists vaporized graphite to produce
a stable form of carbon molecule consisting of
60 carbon atoms in a roughly spherical shape,
looking like a soccer ball.

Geologists believe that most mountains are
formed by movements in the earth’s crust.

sation, since the answers do not contain the ques-
tion terms “mosquito” (for question 2) and “form”
(for question 3), but only their inflected forms
“mosquitoes” and “formed”.

6 Conclusion and Future Work

We have presented three datasets for training sta-
tistical word translation models for use in answer
finding: question-answer pairs, manually-tagged
question reformulations and glosses for the same
term extracted from several lexical semantic re-
sources. It is the first time that the two latter types
of datasets have been used for this task. We have
also provided the first intrinsic evaluation of word
translation probabilities with respect to human re-
latedness rankings for reference word pairs. This
evaluation has shown that, despite the simplicity
of the method, monolingual translation models are
comparable to concept vector semantic relatedness
measures for this task. Moreover, models based on
translation probabilities yield significant improve-
ment over baseline approaches for answer finding,
especially when different types of training data are
combined. The experiments bear strong evidence
that several datasets encode different and comple-
mentary types of knowledge, which are all use-
ful for retrieval. In order to integrate semantics

in retrieval, it is therefore advisable to combine
both knowledge specific to the task at hand, e.g.
question-answer pairs, and external knowledge, as
contained in lexical semantic resources.

In the future, we would like to further evalu-
ate the models presented in this paper for different
tasks, such as question paraphrase retrieval, and
larger datasets. We also plan to improve ques-
tion analysis by automatically identifying question
topic and question focus.
