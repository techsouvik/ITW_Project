Abstract

We investigate the influence of informa-
tion status (IS) on constituent order in Ger-
man, and integrate our findings into a log-
linear surface realisation ranking model.
We show that the distribution of pairs of IS
categories is strongly asymmetric. More-
over, each category is correlated with mor-
phosyntactic features, which can be au-
tomatically detected. We build a log-
linear model that incorporates these asym-
metries for ranking German string reali-
sations from input LFG F-structures. We
show that it achieves a statistically signif-
icantly higher BLEU score than the base-
line system without these features.

1 Introduction

There are many factors that influence word order,
e.g. humanness, definiteness, linear order of gram-
matical functions, givenness, focus, constituent
weight. In some cases, it can be relatively straight-
forward to automatically detect these features (i.e.
in the case of definiteness, this is a syntactic prop-
erty). The more complex the feature, the more dif-
ficult it is to automatically detect. It is common
knowledge that information status1 (henceforth,
IS) has a strong influence on syntax and word or-
der; for instance, in inversions, where the subject
follows some preposed element, Birner (1994) re-
ports that the preposed element must not be newer
in the discourse than the subject. We would like
to be able to use information related to IS in the
automatic generation of German text. Ideally, we
would automatically annotate text with IS labels
and learn from this data. Unfortunately, however,
to date, there has been little success in automati-
cally annotating text with IS.

1We take information status to be a subarea of information
structure; the one dealing with varieties of givenness but not
with contrast and focus in the strictest sense.

We believe, however, that despite this shortcom-
ing, we can still take advantage of some of the in-
sights gained from looking at the influence of IS
on word order. Specifically, we look at the prob-
lem from a more general perspective by comput-
ing an asymmetry ratio for each pair of IS cate-
gories. Results show that there are a large num-
ber of pairs exhibiting clear ordering preferences
when co-occurring in the same clause. The ques-
tion then becomes, without being able to auto-
matically detect these IS category pairs, can we,
nevertheless, take advantage of these strong asym-
metric patterns in generation. We investigate the
(automatically detectable) morphosyntactic char-
acteristics of each asymmetric IS pair and inte-
grate these syntactic asymmetric properties into
the generation process.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2
outlines the underlying realisation ranking system
for our experiments. Section 3 introduces infor-
mation status and Section 4 describes how we ex-
tract and measure asymmetries in information sta-
tus. In Section 5, we examine the syntactic charac-
teristics of the IS asymmetries. Section 6 outlines
realisation ranking experiments to test the integra-
tion of IS into the system. We discuss our findings
in Section 7 and finally we conclude in Section 8.

2 Generation Ranking

The task we are considering is generation rank-
ing. In generation (or more specifically, surface
realisation) ranking, we take an abstract represen-
tation of a sentence (for example, as produced by
a machine translation or automatic summarisation
system), produce a number of alternative string
realisations corresponding to that input and use
some model to choose the most likely string. We
take the model outlined in Cahill et al. (2007), a
log-linear model based on the Lexical Functional
Grammar (LFG) Framework (Kaplan and Bres-
nan, 1982). LFG has two main levels of represen-

The input to the generation system is an F-
Structure. A hand-crafted, bi-directional LFG of
German (Rohrer and Forst, 2006) is used to gener-
ate all possible strings (licensed by the grammar)
for this input. As the grammar is hand-crafted,
it is designed only to parse (and therefore) gen-
erate grammatical strings.2 The task of the reali-
sation ranking system is then to choose the most
likely string. Cahill et al. (2007) describe a log-
linear model that uses linguistically motivated fea-
tures and improves over a simple tri-gram lan-
guage model baseline. We take this log-linear
model as our starting point.3

2There are some rare instances of the grammar parsing
and therefore also generating ungrammatical output.

3Forst (2007) presents a model for parse disambiguation
that incorporates features such as humanness, definiteness,
linear order of grammatical functions, constituent weight.
Many of these features are already present in the Cahill et
al. (2007) model.

An error analysis of the output of that system
revealed that sometimes “unnatural” outputs were
being selected as most probable, and that often
information structural effects were the cause of
subtle differences in possible alternatives. For
instance, Example (3) appeared in the original
TIGER corpus with the 2 preceding sentences (2).

‘Because, the legal benchmark has explicitly been con-
firmed by the lower instance, the Saxonian Higher Ad-
ministrative Court. And it indicates: the participation
in the political criminal law of the GDR as well as
deficits regarding the critical debate on totalitarian con-
victions justify an expulsion from the judiciary.’

‘People have learnt from dealing with the past mis-

The five alternatives output by the grammar are:

a. Man hat aus der Vergangenheitsaufarbeitung gelernt.

c. Aus der Vergangenheitsaufarbeitung gelernt hat man.

d. Gelernt hat man aus der Vergangenheitsaufarbeitung.

e. Gelernt hat aus der Vergangenheitsaufarbeitung man.

The string chosen as most likely by the system of
Cahill et al. (2007) is Alternative (b). No mat-
ter whether the context in (2) is available or the
sentence is presented without any context, there
seems to be a preference by native speakers for
the original string (a). Alternative (e) is extremely
marked4 to the point of being ungrammatical. Al-
ternative (c) is also very marked and so is Alterna-
tive (d), although less so than (c) and (e). Alter-
native (b) is a little more marked than the original
string, but it is easier to imagine a preceding con-
text where this sentence would be perfectly appro-
priate. Such a context would be, e.g. (4).

(4) Vergangenheitsaufarbeitung und Abwiegeln sind zwei
sehr unterschiedliche Arten, mit dem Geschehenen
umzugehen.

‘Dealing with the mistakes or playing them down are
two very different ways to handle the past.’

If we limit ourselves to single sentences, the
task for the model is then to choose the string that
is closest to the “default” expected word order (i.e.
appropriate in the most number of contexts). In
this work, we concentrate on integrating insights
from work on information status into the realisa-
tion ranking process.

3 Information Status

The concept of information status (Prince, 1981;
Prince, 1992) involves classifying NP/PP/DP ex-
pressions in texts according to various ways of
their being given or new. It replaces and specifies
more clearly the often vaguely used term given-
ness. The process of labelling a corpus for IS can
be seen as a means of discourse analysis. Different
classification systems have been proposed in the
literature; see Riester (2008a) for a comparison of
several IS labelling schemes and Riester (2008b)
for a new proposal based on criteria from presup-
position theory. In the work described here, we
use the scheme of Riester (2008b). His main theo-
retic assumption is that IS categories (for definites)
should group expressions according to the contex-
tual resources in which their presuppositions find
an antecedent. For definites, the set of main cate-
gory labels found in Table 1 is assumed.

The idea of resolution contexts derives from
the concept of a presupposition trigger (e.g. a
definite description) as potentially establishing an

cialised contexts in which this sentence is acceptable.

there are some expressions whose referent cannot
be identified and needs to be accommodated, com-
pare (5).

‘the leadership crisis lasting for months among the
Hamburg Social Democrats’

Examples like this one have been mentioned
early on in the literature (e.g. Hawkins (1978),
Clark and Marshall (1981)). Nevertheless, label-
ing schemes so far have neglected this issue, which
is explicitly incorporated in the system of Riester
(2008b).

The status of an expression is ACCESSIBLE-
GENERAL (or unused, following Prince (1981))
if it is not present in the previous discourse but
refers to an entity that is known to the intended
recipent. There is a further differentiation of the
ACCESSIBLE-GENERAL class into generic (TYPE)
and non-generic (TOKEN) items.

An expression is D-GIVEN (or textually evoked)
if and only if an antecedent is available in the
discourse context. D-GIVEN entities are subdi-
vided according to whether they are repetitions of
their antecedent, short forms thereof, pronouns or
whether they use new linguistic material to add in-
formation about an already existing discourse ref-
erent (label: EPITHET). Examples representing a
co-reference chain are shown in (6).

There are a few more subdivisions. Table 3,
for instance, contains the labels BRIDGING-CON-
TAINED and PARTITIVE-CONTAINED, going back
to Prince’s (1981:236) “containing inferrables”.
The entire IS label inventory used in this study
comprises 19 (sub)classes in total.

4 Asymmetries in IS

In order to find out whether IS categories are un-
evenly distributed within German sentences we
examine a corpus of German radio news bulletins
that has been manually annotated for IS (496 an-
notated sentences in total) using the scheme of
Riester (2008b).5

For each pair of IS labels X and Y we count
how often they co-occur in the corpus within a sin-
gle clause. In doing so, we distinguish the num-
bers for “X preceding Y ” (= A) and “Y preceding
X” (= B). The larger group is referred to as the
dominant order. Subsequently, we compute a ratio
indicating the degree of asymmetry between the
two orders. If, for instance, the dominant pattern
occurs 20 times (A) and the reverse pattern only 5
times (B), the asymmetry ratio B/A is 0.25.6

5The corpus was labeled by two independent annotators
and the results were compared by a third person who took
the final decision in case of disagreement. An evaluation as
regards inter-coder agreement is currently underway.

6Even if some of the sentences we are learning from are
marked in terms of word order, the ratios allow us to still learn
the predominant order, since the marked order should occur
much less frequently and the ratio will remain low.

Table 3: Asymmetric pairs of IS labels

Table 3 gives the top asymmetry pairs down to
a ratio of about 1:3 as well as, down at the bottom,
the pairs that are most evenly distributed. This
means that the top pairs exhibit strong ordering
preferences and are, hence, unevenly distributed
in German sentences. For instance, the ordering
D-GIVEN-PRONOUN before INDEF-REL (top line),
shown in Example (8), occurs 19 times in the ex-
amined corpus while there is no example in the
corpus for the reverse order.7

5 Syntactic IS Asymmetries

It seems that IS could, in principle, be quite bene-
ficial in the generation ranking task. The problem,
of course, is that we do not possess any reliable
system of automatically assigning IS labels to un-
known text and manual annotations are costly and
time-consuming. As a substitute, we identify a list

ungrammatical or impossible, we just observe that it is ex-
tremely infrequent.

820



of morphosyntactic characteristics that the expres-
sions can adopt and investigate how these are cor-
related to our inventory of IS categories.

For some IS labels there is a direct link between
the typical phrases that fall into that IS category,
and the syntactic features that describe it. One
such example is D-GIVEN-PRONOUN, which al-
ways corresponds to a pronoun, or EXPL which
always corresponds to expletive items. Such syn-
tactic markers can easily be identified in the LFG
F-structures. On the other hand, there are many
IS labels for which there is no clear cut syntac-
tic class that describes its typical phrases. Ex-
amples include NEW, ACCESSIBLE-GENERAL or
ACCESSIBLE-DESCRIPTION.

In order to determine whether we can ascertain
a set of syntactic features that are representative
of a particular IS label, we design an inventory of
syntactic features that are found in all types of IS
phrases. The complete inventory is given in Table
5. It is a much easier task to identify these syntac-
tic characteristics than to try and automatically de-
tect IS labels directly, which would require a deep
semantic understanding of the text. We automati-
cally mark up the news corpus with these syntactic
characteristics, giving us a corpus both annotated
for IS and syntactic features.

We can now identify, for each IS label, what the
most frequent syntactic characteristics of that la-
bel are. Some examples and their frequencies are
given in Table 4.

teristics with the asymmetries presented in Table 3

8For reasons of space, we are only showing the very top
of the table.

6 Generation Ranking Experiments

Using the augmented set of IS asymmetries,
we design new features to be included into the
original model of Cahill et al. (2007). For each
IS asymmetry, we extract all precedence patterns
of the corresponding syntactic features. For
example, from the first asymmetry in Table 6, we
extract the following features:

PERS PRON precedes INDEF ATTR

PERS PRON precedes SIMPLE INDEF

DA PRON precedes INDEF ATTR

DA PRON precedes SIMPLE INDEF

DEMON PRON precedes INDEF ATTR

DEMON PRON precedes SIMPLE INDEF

GENERIC PRON precedes INDEF ATTR

GENERIC PRON precedes SIMPLE INDEF

We extract these patterns for all of the asym-
metric pairs in Table 3 (augmented with syntac-
tic characteristics) that have a ratio >0.4. The
patterns we extract need to be checked for incon-
sistencies because not all of them are valid. By
inconsistencies, we mean patterns of the type X
precedes X, Y precedes Y, and any pat-
tern where the variant X precedes Y as well
as Y precedes X is present. These are all auto-
matically removed from the list of features to give
a total of 130 new features for the log-linear rank-
ing model.

We train the log-linear ranking model on 7759
F-structures from the TIGER treebank. We gen-
erate strings from each F-structure and take the
original treebank string to be the labelled exam-
ple. All other examples are viewed as unlabelled.
We tune the parameters of the log-linear model on
a small development set of 63 sentences, and carry
out the final evaluation on 261 unseen sentences.
The ranking results of the model with the addi-
tional IS-inspired features are given in Table 7.

2002). We achieve an improvement of 0.0168
BLEU points and 1.91 percentage points in exact
match. The improvement in BLEU is statistically
significant (p < 0.01) using the paired bootstrap
resampling significance test (Koehn, 2004).

Going back to Example (3), the new model
chooses a “better” string than the Cahill et al.
(2007) model. The new model chooses the orig-
inal string. While the string chosen by the Cahill
et al. (2007) system is also a perfectly valid sen-
tence, our empirical findings from the news corpus
were that the default order of generic pronoun be-
fore definite NP were more frequent. The system
with the new features helped to choose the original
string, as it had learnt this asymmetry.

Was it just the syntax?

The results in Table 7 clearly show that the new
model is beneficial. However, we want to know
how much of the improvement gained is due to
the IS asymmetries, and how much the syntactic
asymmetries on their own can contribute. To this
end, we carry out a further experiment where we
calculate syntactic asymmetries based on the au-
tomatic markup of the corpus, and ignore the IS
labels completely. Again we remove any incon-
sistent asymmetries and only choose asymmetries
with a ratio of higher than 0.4. The top asymme-
tries are given in Table 8.

Table 8: Purely syntactic asymmetries

For each asymmetry, we create a new feature X
precedes Y. This results in a total of 66 fea-
tures. Of these 30 overlap with the features used
in the above experiment. We do not include the
features extracted in the first attempt in this exper-
iment. The same training procedure is carried out
and we test on the same heldout test set of 261 sen-

tences. The results are given in Table 9. Finally,
we combine the two lists of features and evaluate,
these results are also presented in Table 9.

Table 9: Results for ranking model with purely
syntactic asymmetry features

They show that although the syntactic asymme-
tries alone contribute to an improvement over the
baseline, the gain is not as large as when the syn-
tactic asymmetries are constrained to correspond
to IS label asymmetries (Model 1).9 Interest-
ingly, the combination of the lists of features does
not result in an improvement over Model 1. The
difference in BLEU score between the model of
Cahill et al. (2007) and the model that only takes
syntactic-based asymmetries into account is not
statistically significant, while the difference be-
tween Model 1 and this model is statistically sig-
nificant (p < 0.05).

7 Discussion

In the work described here, we concentrate only on
taking advantage of the information that is read-
ily available to us. Ideally, we would like to be
able to use the IS asymmetries directly as features,
however, without any means of automatically an-
notating new text with these categories, this is im-
possible. Our experiments were designed to test,
whether we can achieve an improvement in the
generation of German text, without a fully labelled
corpus, using the insight that at least some IS cate-
gories correspond to morphosyntactic characteris-
tics that can be easily identified. We do not claim
to go beyond this level to the point where true IS
labels would be used, rather we attempt to pro-
vide a crude approximation of IS using only mor-
phosyntactic information. To be able to fully auto-
matically annotate text with IS labels, one would
need to supplement the morphosyntactic features

9The difference may also be due to the fewer features used
in the second experiment. However, this emphasises, that
the asymmetries gleaned from syntactic information alone are
not strong enough to be able to determine the prevailing order
of constituents. When we take the IS labels into account, we
are honing in on a particular subset of interesting syntactic
asymmetries.

with information about anaphora resolution, world
knowledge, ontologies, and possibly even build
dynamic discourse representations.

We would also like to emphasise that we are
only looking at one sentence at a time. Of course,
there are other inter-sentential factors (not relying
on external resources) that play a role in choosing
the optimal string realisation, for example paral-
lelism or the position of the sentence in the para-
graph or text. Given that we only looked at IS fac-
tors within a sentence, we think that such a sig-
nificant improvement in BLEU and exact match
scores is very encouraging. In future work, we will
look at what information can be automatically ac-
quired to help generation ranking based on more
than one sentence.

While the experiments presented this paper are
limited to a German realisation ranking system,
there is nothing in the methodology that precludes
it from being applied to another language. The IS
annotation scheme is language-independent, and
so all one needs to be able to apply this to another
language is a corpus annotated with IS categories.

We extracted our IS asymmetry patterns from a
small corpus of spoken news items. This corpus
contains text of a similar domain to the TIGER
treebank. Further experiments are required to de-
termine how domain specific the asymmetries are.

Much related work on incorporating informa-
tion status (or information structure) into language
generation has been on spoken text, since infor-
mation structure is often encoded by means of
prosody. In a limited domain setting, Prevost
(1996) describes a two-tiered information struc-
ture representation. During the high level plan-
ning stage of generation, using a small knowl-
edge base, elements in the discourse are automat-
ically marked as new or given. Contrast and fo-
cus are also assigned automatically. These mark-
ings influence the final string generated. We are
focusing on a broad-coverage system, and do not
use any external world-knowledge resources. Van
Deemter and Odijk (1997) annotate the syntac-
tic component from which they are generating
with information about givenness. This informa-
tion is determined by detecting contradictions and
parallel sentences. Pulman (1997) also uses in-
formation about parallelism to predict word or-
der. In contrast, we only look at one sentence
when we approximate information status, future
work will look at cross sentential factors. Endriss

and Klabunde (2000) describe a sentence planner
for German that annotates the propositional in-
put with discourse-related features in order to de-
termine the focus, and thus influence word order
and accentuation. Their system, again, is domain-
specific (generating monologue describing a film
plot) and requires the existence of a knowledge
base. The same holds for Yampolska (2007), who
presents suggestions for generating information
structure in Russian and Ukrainian football re-
ports, using rules to determine parallel structures
for the placement of contrastive accent, following
similar work by Theune (1997). While our paper
does not address the generation of speech / accen-
tuation, it is of course conceivable to employ the
IS annotated radio news corpus from which we de-
rived the label asymmetries (and which also exists
in a spoken and prosodically annotated version) in
a similar task of learning the correlations between
IS labels and pitch accents. Finally, Bresnan et
al. (2007) present work on predicting the dative
alternation in English using 14 features relating to
information status which were manually annotated
in their corpus. In our work, we manually annotate
a small corpus in order to learn generalisations.
From these we learn features that approximate the
generalisations, enabling us to apply them to large
amounts of unseen data without further manual an-
notation.

8 Conclusions

In this paper we presented a novel method of in-
cluding IS into the task of generation ranking.
Since automatic annotation of IS labels them-
selves is not currently possible, we approximate
the IS categories by their syntactic characteristics.
By calculating strong asymmetries between pairs
of IS labels, and establishing the most frequent
syntactic characteristics of these asymmetries, we
designed a new set of features for a log-linear
ranking model. In comparison to a baseline model,
we achieve statistically significant improvement in
BLEU score. We showed that these improvements
were not only due to the effect of purely syntac-
tic asymmetries, but that the IS asymmetries were
what drove the improved model.
